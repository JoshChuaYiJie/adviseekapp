        "description": "Sustainability focuses on meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. The concept of business sustainability comprises three pillars: economic, environmental and social (Human & Labor) - also known as people, planet and profits. (Investopedia https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sustainability.asp_). The focus recently (including by regulators) has added a fourth pillar - governance (anti-bribery and corruption). Organizations in the pursuit of profit have been implicated in a number of scandals involving bribery & corruption, fraud, labor and human rights abuses, and environmental degradation. What role does law and ethics play in holding companies and individuals responsible for such scandals? How can companies ensure that they pay attention to social, environmental and governance factors and remain profitable? How do individuals and organizations decide what is the right thing to do? This course will require students to understand broad business sustainability issues and to apply ethical reasoning processes to decision making. As sustainability, anti-corruption and corporate social responsibility (\"CSR\") issues gain recognition as fundamental to strategy and execution in all organizations, this course will examine the measures we can take to ensure sustainability. Initiatives & laws such as Anti-Bribery and Corruption (e.g., the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act), the Sustainable Development Goals, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Global Compact will be considered, along with practical examples of implementation or lack thereof. The focus will be on best practices in addressing sustainability/CSR challenges and opportunities faced by all entities/organizations. Entities that incorporate sustainability practices into their operations benefit directly and indirectly, including but not limited to, productivity gains, improved image and enhanced reputation, and attraction and retention of human capital. We will discuss some international and local laws that are relevant to doing business in Singapore, Asia and globally. We will refer to industry codes and/or case studies to identify practical examples of corporate implementation of good governance, or lack thereof. We will examine the elements of an effective compliance program as a tool to risk management. At the completion of this course, you will gain an understanding of the importance of incorporating legal, ethical and sustainability practices in your careers and how these benefits entities in productivity gains, improved image and enhanced reputation, and attraction and retention of human capital and in stakeholder management. All students will benefit from the content - whether they chose a career in for profit or not for profit companies or in government. These skills are relevant to everyone and cut across all industries and professions and are necessary in your personal as well as professional life. Ethical leadership is becoming a fundamental success factor in today's dynamic external environment."

It will help you to present yourself confidently, persuasively, and professionally in the way you speak, write and participate in your chosen profession.\nAB0602 starts with the basic - and well-rounded - premise that Communication Theory, Strategies and Skills are all needed in a highly complementary way for today's young executives preparing for workplace effectiveness. Theory provides a conceptual framework that guides strategy and skills. Strategy allows communicators to make intelligent choices about content, organisation, style, tone, delivery, and timing of messages. Skills are needed to craft effective written documents, give constructive feedback, and create as well as deliver persuasive business presentations. Throughout, the emphasis is on the art of persuasion for effectiveness in the corporate context.\nIn addition, the course addresses other new demands in today's work culture. One such emerging demand is the need for effective Small Group Communication, a skill valued for collaborative work and team building. As such, you will be trained to go beyond prepared presentations to help you operate effectively in contexts which require spontaneous yet formal communication. Such contexts include small talk, meetings, team briefings and group discussions.\nAnother new demand comes with the prevalence of online communication. To prepare for this trend, you will be guided to enhance your Executive Presence (EP) in both face-to-face and online settings, with special emphasis on social media and personal branding. Building on the theoretical foundation provided by EP experts, you will learn how to be an effective communicator across each medium - in-person, written or virtually - and in diverse situations. \nFinally, this course also offers you the opportunity to acquire an understanding of the method of Principled Negotiation developed by the Harvard Negotiation Project. You will gain hands-on experience in negotiation through engagement in negotiation simulations.\nTo sum up, this course is planned to align with the broader vision of preparing you well for the workplace and address the increasingly complex needs of industry. As Mr. Ong Ye Kung, speaking as Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills), has noted: 'IHLs (institutes of higher learning) must help students to build up their essential soft skills, such as interpersonal skills, working in teams and across cultures, the ability to communicate well, negotiate effectively, and be resourceful and enterprising.'\nApproximating the real-world work environment and culture to the extent possible for a course, the teaching approach consistently keeps the final outcome in mind:\n'your development as a work-ready young executive able to operate in the corporate context with presence and persuasion.'"

        "description": "Before the outbreak of the global pandemic, change management was already one of the top leadership priorities in organizations. Yet a significant number of organizations reported a high failure rate in driving change initiatives. The process of change and the resistance to change, if not well managed, could result in unproductive work or even unintended negative consequences.  The disappointing outcomes occurred because changes often affected multiple levels, from individuals? mindset, group routines, to organizational inertia.  Fortunately, there are ways to mitigate such risks and increase the probability of successful change implementation.  Organizational leaders, together with their human resource practitioners, are often involved in the planning and executing of change for their teams and organizations.  \n\nThis course aims to equip seminar participants with the necessary knowledge of the different forms of change that take place in organizations, and the processes entailed in leading and managing change. Using seminars and discussion groups, the course will cover change management frameworks and concepts, explore the nature and context of change, examine alternative change management approaches and examine how best to implement predetermined change strategies, especially in the context of digital disruption."

Much of what we know about aging today comes from studying how C. elegans ages in the laboratory. With a life span of a little over two weeks, C. elegans is perfect for providing a quick view of the aging process. These microscopic roundworms display visible signs of aging where they slow down, stop reproducing and even develop wrinkled skin. This course aims to provide undergraduate students opportunities for in-depth learning and training in conducting experiments for studying biology of aging in worms focusing on experimental design, skill-sets, data acquisitions and analyses. In line with Technology-Enabled Learning (TEL), the course has developed a series of pre-class video lessons to cover the seminars and lab experimental preview and setup for online learning.

Yet a significant number of organizations reported a high failure rate in driving change initiatives. The process of change and the resistance to change, if not well managed, could result in unproductive work or even unintended negative consequences.  The disappointing outcomes occurred because changes often affected multiple levels, from individuals? mindset, group routines, to organizational inertia.  Fortunately, there are ways to mitigate such risks and increase the probability of successful change implementation.  Organizational leaders, together with their human resource practitioners, are often involved in the planning and executing of change for their teams and organizations.  \n\nThis course aims to equip seminar participants with the necessary knowledge of the different forms of change that take place in organizations, and the processes entailed in leading and managing change.

Forward-looking corporations such as Barclays, Walmart, and Procter and Gamble, as well as governmental agencies in the United States and Singapore are now applying insights from the principles of behavioural decision science to guide the design of products and services and even policy. This course is specially designed to help students understand how humans (consumers, doctors, accountants, policy makers, managers, parents, and students themselves) make -good or bad- decisions. Ever since Daniel Kahneman was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2002, we have a more accurate understanding of the fact that people do not necessarily obey rational rules in making decisions. This does not mean that decisions are made randomly; on the contrary, an alternate set of rules is at play. Even though the human brain is capable of making millions of calculations per second, it cannot avoid the influences of these biases. Research in cognitive sciences, psychology, behavioural economics and decision neuroscience is guiding us to a fuller understanding of how decisions are made by people. Empowered with this knowledge, you (students) will not only improve your own decision making but also explore ways to design organizations that help people make better decisions. You will learn the decision-making processes and biases that impact choice behaviour. Examples include but not limited to: What are examples of irrational decision making and what are the reasons of this behavior? How do customers make their purchase choices? How do people decide to save (or not)? How do we persuade people to climb the stairs instead of using the elevator? How do our biology and brain influence our decision making? How does the environment influence our behaviour? How does the brain assess risk, trust, time? Overall, you will develop strategic awareness about the biases that could influence judgment and lead to suboptimal decisions."

This will also give the students a valuable opportunity to interact personally with food industries and have a deeper understanding of the food policies and issues around the world.\n\nThis course is aimed to raise awareness among students about real world challenges in food industry around the world and in Singapore. Subjects such as food security, food sustainability and food waste management will be the main focus for every week's seminar.\n\nA convergence of factors has made food security one of the most important global issues. An increasing population wants a more varied diet, but is trying to grow more food on less land with limited access to water, all the time facing increased costs for fertiliser, and fuel for storage and transport.\n\nEven after food is grown, stored and transported, serious losses can occur, and in developing nations where `plentiful? food is wasted. A review of food waste in the US calculated that around 20% of the amount available to consume, was lost from retailing onwards. This translate to 20% of the land, water, labour, seed, pesticide and fertiliser are wasted in the process and thus this is also a financial and environmental loss too.\n\nIn view of the growing world population and thus a growing demand in food, most of the food produced today is reflective of an unsustainable food system. This food is dependent on foreign oil, is destroying soil, contaminates water, has caused disease outbreaks, and may be robbing our future generations of the ability to grow food at all."

This is vital to modern branding, defining your company ethos and building long-term customer relationships. This course concentrates on visual storytelling for cinema, television and multi-media. \n\nStory depends on solid structuring and the ability to utilise storytelling to awaken the imagination of the buyer, but first and foremost it is about emotion: generating the right degree of emotion and aligning that to company and product branding for given visual media. We therefore need to understand psychology and have real insight into people, not just as a persuasive tool, but a genuine understanding of what people's deepest desires are and how your brand delivers that desire. Having understood the tones, attitudes and empathy generated by your product, we must then structure well. There are two concepts we need to understand to convey this: striking the note of simplicity to engage the emotions and secondly basing those stories on timeless myths and storytelling principles. \n\nHaving instilled all this, we must then question the nature of advertising as a metacognitive process for the designer of commercials. This provides perspectives on the story being told and why we are compelled to tell it well. By viewing advertising examples from cinema, television and multi-media and investigating the myths and principles that underpin their success, this course reaches deep into the creativity of the student to grow beyond outmoded forms of selling and embrace the future of visual sales-personship.\n\nThe course therefore generates competency in storytelling for practitioners and researchers in the field of effective advertising. Enrollment is suited to advertising students, advertising industry practitioners, journalists, communications students as well as film, television and transmedia practitioners."

This represents experiential learning as we assist you to master your chosen medium within a wider technological and narrative context. As such, you will be re-familiarized with screenwriting for multi-media distribution platforms, utilizing your discipline specific talents in various and flexible approaches to contrasting platforms. \n\nYou will enhance your writing skills for contrasting media and develop modern writing skills in small teams. i.e., one group of students may embrace storytelling for online gaming, another may adopt traditional filmic storytelling, another group may discover non-traditional uses of screenwriting in varied environments such as interactive narratives, another might adopt visual installation art or distributing social media - depending on which students enroll, your established skills, class sizes and what your interests are. You are encouraged to locate the specific qualities of your chosen platform. Each platform component will embrace its own defining story but will also be aligned to a major story operating as overarching link between its constituent parts. This is the story in multimedia, and it is inherently ahead of industry. So, while industry experience and advice are included in the course you will essentially be involved in forging a new and future path for an industry which is ripe for it."

Cyber physical systems are the driving force behind modern civilization, being integral part of technologies, such as additive manufacturing, smartcard-based payment, power delivery systems, drone-based operations, and smart home automation. Cyber physical systems are characterized by stringent performance requirements, such as, extremely low energy budget, small area footprint and often hard real-time constraints. Due to the pervasive nature of the cyber physical systems in our everyday lives, it also runs the risk of huge security hazards. In this course, we will learn about the basics of cyber physical systems, including the design principles and methodologies. Further, there will be a detailed treatment of the security challenges for cyber physical systems, which vary in practice due to the diverse nature of the application environment of cyber physical systems. These different forms of security breaches, observed across diverse cyber physical systems, will be put in a well-characterized taxonomy, to be systematically identified as attack surfaces. The techniques to handle these attacks will be described in a generic manner, including key management and wireless/RFID communication. The attack surfaces and protection/mitigation principles will then be elaborated with practical case studies, from the representative cyber physical systems such as automotive, smart card systems and smart grid."

When malware breaches an organization's defences, the security team needs to act quickly to cure current infections and prevent it from re-occurring. Understanding the capabilities of the malware is critical to an organization's ability to quickly create a signature to prevent the widespread of the malware across the network, to block further communications from the attacker. This understanding could also be translated to valuable knowledge in identifying existing security gaps within an organization's system and fortify defences. This course aims to build a strong foundation to perform triage on malicious software using a variety of system and network monitoring utilities, a disassembler, a debugger and many other freely available tools."

In fact, the existence of living beings in this planet depends on the ability of thousands of proteins to work together in a seamless fashion. Furthermore, our ability to comprehend our surroundings is heavily influenced by the activity of billions of neurons in our brain. Such complex systems can be represented as static or dynamic networks of many interacting components. These components are typically much simpler in terms of behavior or function than the overall system, implying that the additional complexity of the latter is an emergent network property. \nNetwork science is a new discipline that investigates the topology and dynamics of such complex networks, aiming to better understand the behavior, function and properties of the underlying systems. In this course, we will study algorithmic, computational, and statistical methods of network science, as well as its applications in solving real-world problems in communications, biology, sociology, and cyber security. The specific topics include network metrics, properties, and models, network querying and analytics, network dynamics, and distributed graph engines.

The study of ethical considerations and issues as such is a critical area of public policy analysis as it addresses one core question that confronts particularly scholars and practitioners of public policy, but also any professional and/or organizational entity with stakes in public policy globally: how (best) to design and implement ethical public policy within a certain societal context? In addressing this core question, you will navigate the different ethical perspectives, issues as well as tensions/dilemmas that arise during the public policy making and implementation phases in key policy sectors primarily, but not exclusively, within the Asia-Pacifi c region. These policy sectors are prominent sectors that are seen in many Asia-pacifi c societies, including the education, economic, housing, social and environmental sectors. Therefore, lectures are focused on delivery of relevant concepts and perspectives relating to ethics in public policy making and implementation. Lectures in the fi rst part of the course will centre around concepts and perspectives on ethics in public policy making and implementation. Lectures in the second part of the course will situate the concepts and perspectives covered in the fi rst part of the course in specifi c case studies that refl ect the abovementioned key policy sectors.

Political parties, in the West at least, have contributed enormously to the flourishing and stability of democracy. Parties link the state and society, take part in elections and contribute towards the structuring (and re-structuring) of political processes and institutions. Yet, the nature of political parties differ throughout time and space; similarly, the nature of elections differ throughout democracies - there is significant diversity in the way the electoral systems are structured, the legislations governing elections, the frequency of elections, the way campaigns are conducted, inter alia. As such, there is a need to understand the differing types of parties and elections, the impact that they have on society and political systems, who runs in elections, how voters make their choices, and the threats to our existing understandings of democracy and elections. This module studies the development of political parties and electoral systems, emphasizing the analytical component (how and why) in addition to the standard descriptive approach (what)."

In the public administration and policy areas, narratives, case studies, observations, and more recently, focus groups have contributed insight and depth to our understanding of the structural, managerial, and environmental factors embedded in the public sector. Given this, you, as an independent researcher, need to understand the philosophy of qualitative, non-statistical social science research, focusing on how to design methods of qualitative research and how to conduct the analysis. The main objective of this course is not only to empower you to critically consume research through various forms of qualitative methods, but also to provide the fundamental skills for their own future rigorous research work (e.g., final year project). More specifically, while studying different qualitative inquiry approaches, you will be able to create a rationale for a qualitative inquiry that will be applicable to their research (or a hypothetical one) and to conduct qualitative research with data production (e.g., interviews, case studies, and observations). Lastly, you will be able to analyze and interpret their data using content or another discourse analytic technique."

Thus, knowing and understanding how the different components of a 'good life' contribute to one's overall functioning is critical to one's healthy wellbeing.  The latter, in turn, affords many benefits such as better health (physical, mental and emotional health) and stronger relationships. \n\nEach week you will explore additional philosophical questions related to well-being, happiness, the self, and the connection between mind and body.

This course will focus, however, less on the explicit political representations presented within specific films (for example, as in the narrative communication of already formed ideological visions of the world), in order to investigate the capacity of film to itself generate unique philosophical and political orientations via its singular form.   Through reading the contributions of contemporary theorists such as Alain Badiou, Jacques Ranciere, William Connolly, Davide Panagia, Joshua Foa Dienstag, Michael Shapiro, and others, we will investigate such diverse topics as film's relation to democratic thinking, the connection between cinematic and political representation, the political economy of film production, and film's embodiment of thinking the event. In addition, we will also examine a select group of particular film genres - specifically the Western, the horror, and the film noir - in order to understand what particular insights they communicate about contemporary political life."

This is especially important as good public policy processes place value on social impact, seeks to understand the behavior of Singapore's diverse society, and makes sense and use of increasingly abundant behavioral data. As the Singaporean economy gets more advanced and complex, and citizens get better educated and informed, we rely on decisions strengthened by sound economic thinking. The economist must move towards more rigorous reasoning across the levels of household, corporate, and public choice. In this course we apply fundamental microeconomic principles complemented by behavioral economics to various current everyday concerns in Singapore.\n\nThe course aims to deliver a progressive and rigorous introduction to basic concepts and models of microeconomics, applied to current trends local and global. Microeconomics is one of the three core pillars of an Economics major. This is an important module that will serve as a prerequisite for almost all major PE modules. The first part of the course covers the theory of individual decision-making in consumption, risk and labor. The second part of the course covers the theory of firms making production decisions when operating under various market structures, in particular price discrimination with market power and strategic interactions between firms. This course will also expose students to new developments in the field of microeconomics which have now come to assume a central role, in particular behavioral economics.\n\nStudents will learn basic theories that can be abstract and simple but yet so relevant and powerful in explaining decision problems in our everyday lives. On the one hand, it will give students with either no previous economics training a chance to close the gap with those with a stronger background. On the other hand, it will give everyone a chance to appreciate microeconomics in action right from the start of their education at NTU - a feature that is surprisingly amiss in many Economics undergraduate programs worldwide."

It encourages a deconstruction of social determinants of health that result in various facets of health inequalities for excluded and underserved health minorities.\nWhat:\nIt explores questions such as: What is health equity/inequity. How is inequity experienced? How are communities currently supported? What can be improved? How can it be improved? \nHow: \nIn order to answer these questions, the course requires learners to become aware of the interaction of various social elements and health experiences; it requires, among others, a multi-disciplinary perspective for the questioning of social, ethical, political, economic, and cultural aspects of health equity.\n\nThis course is an opportunity to become aware of contemporary social inequities in order to encourage awareness, compassion, and greater inclusion and equity in society."

        "description": "Surveys in many countries conducted over decades show that, on average, people's happiness and life satisfaction have not changed much over the last fifty years, despite large increase in real income per capita for many countries. In other words, people are not getting any happier or feeling more satisfied with life even when the whole country is becoming richer than it has been in the past. What explains this missing link between economic growth and happiness? If economic growth does not lead to an increase in people's general sense of wellbeing, then what does?  \nThis module aims to provide an overview of the new science of well-being and its link with economic decisions. It will explore the idea of well-being as an alternative measure of success at the individual level, at the organisational level, and at the country level. It will investigate how well-being is typically measured, and what their main determinants usually are across different countries and time periods. It will also explore the practical implications of wellbeing in the workplace, and how we can use it in cost-benefit analysis and in policy design.\nOther topics to be discussed include whether money buys happiness; and if so, how much does it buy? What are the key ingredients to a happy workplace? What are the links between wellbeing and productivity? How does wellbeing linked to choices, and do people always make the right choice for themselves? What future behaviours can happiness today predict? What predicts wellbeing from birth to old age? Why should policy makers care more about enhancing people's wellbeing than simply boosting profits and economic growth? The goal is to broaden students' understanding of what factors determine individual's subjective experiences, and to learn how this knowledge can be applied in business and policy settings.\nStudents who have special interests in behavioural economics, public policy, and innovative businesses with human well-being at the core of the firm?s strategies should take this module. People with a background in the economics of mental health and well-being have found jobs working for the government and NGOs, creating a start-up company that caters directly to improving their clients' well-being, and working in academia."

The cognitive function of our brain tricks us into thinking that they are different. Behavioral Economics studies how psychological limitations influence economic decision makings. In particular, it focuses on how adding important and more realistic human psychological attributes, which include:\n\n1. Bounded rationality; Why people sometimes make seemingly irrational decisions such as taking more risks when they experience losses and being more risk-averse when they experience gains?\n\n2. Bounded willpower; Why people often have difficulties in carrying out activities and actions that they had already earlier planned? For example, often, people desire to save more for retirement but unable to commit to doing so because they face the temptation to spend their money now.\n\n3. Bounded self-interest; Why are people not entirely selfish as assumed in the standard economics analysis? They often are willing to sacrifice their monetary payoffs to uphold fairness and (or) to help unfortunate others. Thus, economics agents are not solely motivated by individual utility maximization.\n\nAll these attributes can have profound impacts on the predictions of the standard economic models and the way we craft economic and social policies."

We will first try to understand why running experiments can help understanding how communication with speech works (as an alternative to introspective or corpus analysis methods) and we'll learn first steps on how to plan an experiments to maximise the chances for obtaining successful results. Basic concepts of statistics will be introduced/reviewed that form an important part of the planning. \n\nIn the second part (sessions 4 to 6) we will learn how to work with speech signals. Basic skills will be acquired with the Praat signal processing software (www.Praat.org). We will record signals, edit them, tag them for ease of analysis, manipulate them and learn about some methods to automatize processes in Praat (scripting). \n\nIn the third part of the course we will discuss how to write a publication type lab report and carry this out on a sample experiment (sessions 7 to 10). We will agree on a topic we will work on together in class. In parallel students will chose their own topics they work on individually. During three sessions we will carry out the experimental planning, data and material collection and analysis. I will provide a sample lab report from this experiment as a template for students' individual reports. \n\nIn the fourth part (11 and 12) students will present their experimental plans in form of a poster or a talk in class and we will discuss the individual projects."

Given the importance of writing and written communication in the contemporary world, writing will be elaborated upon as a topic worthy of scientific enquiry, particularly with reference to different technologies and media, both `old' and `new'. One week will be devoted to an overview of different scripts and writing systems around the world, and examination how (and why) they can (and should) be studied as important semiotic resources for meaning-making and textual production. We will then move on to review and assess different types of written discourse and different ways to analyze them. After each of these segments, students will be expected to work on relevant assignments in order to get hands-on experience with working with written discourse. Finally, we will address some of the practicalities of analyzing written discourse and examine a number of examples of how written discourse analysis can be used by non linguists whose primary research questions are not about language and language use."

        "institution": "NTU",
        "description": "The Green Earth covers some of the most important themes in environmental history which have informed academic scholarship during the last 20 to 30 years. The course begins by examining the impact of the environment on early human evolution and development of early complex societies in the world. It explores the recent proliferation of works on world history which argue that climate change (in the form of a period of warming around 12,000 years ago) led to the stimulation of human actions which had brought about early agriculture and settled complex societies. The bulk of the course focuses on human transformation and exploitation of the environment in various regions of the world as well in through different ways. The lectures are organized according to elements, starting with agriculture (-land?) and proceeding to water and fire. The subject of environmental history is closely linked not only with human history and continuous desire to harness energy, but also the subjects of biological exchange (germs and pathogens) and the impact of human actions on the environment including animals, particularly with reference to the extinction of species, deforestation, and the destruction of the earth`s greenery. The course examines how these human actions over several millennia, which have been most deliberate and strongest in the past 200 years, have lasting repercussions on the earth, particularly in the form of climate change. Current debates on climate change and strategies to save the environment will be covered at the end of the course."

Science is often considered the paradigm of humans' rational thoughts that fight against all kinds of ignorance, bigotry, and superstition, which may include religious thoughts and practices. However, many historians of science after the late twentieth century have found that the relationship between science and religion is far more complex. In some cases, religions do hamper and suppress some scientists' claims and activities, but religions can also be a positive factor in the construction of scientific ideas and worldviews, including those for the rise of modern science.

        "description": "This module explores the diplomatic, political, social and economic history of British Hong Kong during the period from 1945 to 1997. It examines how development in China and decolonization of the British Empire influenced Sino-British relations and the British colony.\n\nHong Kong was important geo-politically. Due to geographical proximity, developments in China and Hong Kong always affected each other. The 1967 riots were a classic example. Historically, the legitimacy of British rule was never recognized by the Chinese governments. Tensions always existed between Britain and China over Hong Kong's future constitutional settlement. Politically, the Chinese Communists and the western governments both treated Hong Kong as a strategic base during the Cold War, advocating competing ideologies. Economically, it served as an economic gateway for the Communist regime to trade with foreign powers and earn foreign exchange. Hong Kong was also unique. Scholars promoted the concept that Hong Kong was a peculiar colony. The colonial government exercised a policy of indirect rule, combining economic laissez-faire with some interventions in for example the provision of social housing. The society underwent rapid urbanization but remained relatively stable. Western and Chinese culture blended. Hong Kong Chinese increasingly differentiated themselves from Mainland Chinese. This module examines the connections between colonial Hong Kong, Britain and China via six inter-locking themes: imperial diplomacy, diplomatic end game, social order and colonial state-building, identity, political culture and economic dynamism. Through exploring the modern history of Hong Kong during the colonial era, useful insights in China's development, international relations and British colonialism can be acquired."

This course will use the history of feminism as a springboard to analyse broader questions surrounding the political, social and cultural history of gender in the modern world.  Since feminists have been at the forefront of questioning political and social norms, this course will examine the intellectual history of feminist thought, as well as the feminist `uses' of history.  It will take a `transnational' approach, not only comparing feminist movements in various parts of the world, but also examining the international networks forged by feminists and the manner in which transnational connections shaped local and national feminist movements.  \n\nThe course begins by considering several historiographical questions, in particular, when did feminism `begin', what were its main periods or `waves' and what has constituted `feminism' historically?  We will then investigate the role of transnational connections, imperialism, nationalism, class and race in shaping nineteenth and early twentieth century feminism.  The second half of the course examines late twentieth century and twenty-first century feminism, especially the inclusions and exclusions of feminist movements on the basis of class, race, sexuality and other social markers.

One of the most neglected resources in any society is the intangible aspects of its cultural and historical heritage. Some countries and regions within countries have been quite successful in marketing certain segments of their cultural and historical heritage. One of the most successful examples in Southeast Asia is Bali, which manages to promote both older and more recently created cultural practices and performances as -traditions-. Today Bali can still be considered a living heritage site in the sense that the Balinese continue their daily ritual practices and routines. However the authenticity of some of the art forms and performances can be questioned. Though this course will address theoretical issues and examples from various places in the world, class discussions and case studies will come predominantly from Asian examples. Some questions to be addressed include the following: what can be considered cultural and historical heritage in each society? Can these be divided into categories such as good and bad, marketable and non-marketable, representative and non-representative, etc? How does a person use heritage tourism as a means of preserving cultural and historical heritage of people who are gradually -losing- their pasts?"

        "description": "Through the interpretation and study of selected works of American literature and culture from 1945 to the present, we will consider the ways that writers respond to changes in the economic, political, and social conditions of the United States during the postmodern era. While some writers reassert long-standing themes such as the individual's quest for freedom defined against the constrictions of status-quo, domestic life (Kerouac, Ginsberg, Morrison, the Confessional Poets), others pose intellectual questions about language and meaning through metafictional innovation (Nabokov, Vonnegut, Barth) or confront national myths such as the American Dream (Dylan, Mamet) and the romance of the Western frontier (McCarthy). In an age where mass culture has replaced intellectual literacy, contemporary American authors ponder the place of the novelist in the world (DeLillo), reflect on the meaning of ethnic identity (Walker), and seek out a critical perspective from which to view the present"

While we will engage closely with questions of traditional literary history, we will also consider how more recent ways of reading and thinking about literature'from deconstruction to queer theory' might enrich our understanding of these mostly canonical works. The course will touch upon a number of 'big' themes in English literature, with particular emphasis on the rise of individualism and the impact of the Reformation on early-modern culture and thought."

Most of us are familiar with the experience of a disjunction between the way the world is, and the way (we think) the world ought to be. Such experiences can at  times attain a certain quality or intensity that makes us reach for the word \"evil,\" and seem to us to require narratives of justification which then legitimize or delegitimize a possible set of actions. At other times, the experience of evil will prompt us to imagine different versions of existing and possible worlds where the terms of existence are more (or less) hospitable to human and/or animal flourishing. Such feats of the imagination may end up placing us on similar vantage ground as the various metaphysical creators of a variety of religious traditions, raising the question of the age-old analogy between author and God. As we go through this course, we will seek to hone our understanding of the meaning(s) we have given to this elusive yet ever-present notion of \"evil,\" paying particular attention to the ways in which various writers and thinkers have been drawn to and/or repelled by its forceful claim on the senses, the intellect, and the imagination. Our investigations will also lead us to philosophers and theologians who have sought to grapple with \"evil\" as a phenomenon and/or a concept, and will interest students in particular with a mind for free, interdisciplinary inquiry into a topic for which there are perhaps no firm answers."

We begin by examining the debates about the value of cultural texts that are not of high cultural origins, and could be treated as commodities within capitalist societies. Questions such as the following will arise: \n1.\tWhat is the impact and significance of commercially produced cultural products?\n2.\tHow do sub- and counter-cultural practices attempt to form `alternative? values systems?\n3.\tWhat happens when alternative cultural formations become transformed into the mainstream?\nYou will be expected to engage with the debate that the course will unveil and attempt to apply concepts learnt critically."

In this, it also seeks to map the genre's most defining topoi: travel through space, time, and parallel universes; experimental technology; alien life; testing the boundaries of the mind and manipulating the body (cloning). Science fiction has always been experimental in its technique as well as in its critique of social, psychological, and scientific definitions of selfhood, and its study taps into encompassing explorations of epistemological as well as ontological anxieties."

This module examines literary works that represent 'globa l cities' - cities that are particularly open to global flows of cultural products, capital, resources (including energy), and people. By inviting you to explore a range of literary forms that feature and respond to Singapore, London, Abu Dha bi and Johannesburg (among others), this module exami nes what global city texts can add to our understanding of world literature as a system and body of work. Students with an interest in globalisation, world literature and literary theory more broadly will thrive on this module and gain strong theoretical foundations to take into future studies, whilst also gaining a renewed  appreciation of global cultural and economic dynamics."

Emily Thompson explains that in the Victorian period the 'sounds that so bothered Carlyle and Goethe were almost identical to those that had been identified by the Buddha centuries earlier: organic sounds created by humans and animals at work and at play' (Soundscape 116). It is not until the early twentieth century, according to Thompson, that machine-generated noises started to impinge upon the everyday lives of people. \n\nCalled the 'Age of Noise,' the turn of twentieth century was filled with the sounds of auditory technologies (the microphone, radio, telephone, and phonograph), public transportation (the elevated train and subway), World War I, construction, factories, steam locomotives, industrial whistles and bells, machine shops, cash registers, washing machines, sewing machines, vacuum cleaners, typewriters, printing machines, automobiles, trucks, and motorcycles.  \n\nThis course explores how modernist writers represented this soundscape. How did they make their narratives sound out? How did the changing soundscape influence and shape their representations of sound and listening?"

Or can we use 'Romantic' to simply categorise poems written between the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries? Focussing primarily on verse, students will examine a rich range of texts labelled 'Romantic', reflecting on what it means to read, sound out, listen to, and critically interpret poetry of the period. The course combines close reading with contextual analysis, giving students the opportunity to develop their understanding of poetic forms and devices while exploring works in their aesthetic, cultural, and political milieu. It also draws together current research in the fields of Romantic studies and poetics with literary criticism published during the period, by writers such as Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Percy Bysshe Shelley. Throughout the semester, students will consider how poems on the syllabus were experienced by Romantic audiences, using the William Blake Archive to access high-resolution reproductions of Blake's illuminated books and the Princeton Prosody Archive to access late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century guidelines for reading poetry aloud."

How widespread were the Arthurian legends across medieval Europe, and what made them so appealing to authors of English literature in more recent centuries? These are some of the questions to be explored on this module, which surveys the long development of several of the major narratives involving King Arthur and his knights, stretching from their medieval origins to modern literary adaptations. The first half of the module focusses on medieval texts, all of which will be studied in translation. You will gain an understanding of the generic, stylistic and thematic individuality of these medieval texts, as well as an awareness of the ways in which each text reflects the composer's explorations of the fundamental moral questions underpinning themes such as chivalric heroism and romantic love. The second half of the module turns towards modern reception, and here you will explore the changing significance and reimaginations of the Arthurian tradition in the nearer past. As Arthurian adaptations and reinventions continue to be produced and to occupy the public consciousness in the twenty-first century, this module seeks to offer you a sense of the enduring qualities of the legends of the `once and future king'."

Singapore is both a city and a country contained in a small geographical space located in Southeast Asia. It houses a diverse population in terms of race, language, religion, class and nationality. It possesses no natural resources, but has a highly educated labour force. Its economy has experienced signifi cant growth rates, particularly in the late 70s and early 80s, coupled with low unemployment. Like most other more developed economies, it now confronts a range of socioeconomic issues (rapidly ageing population, declining fertility rates, widening income inequality, rising costs of living) amidst increasing global competition, technological advancements, and security threats. At the same time, Singaporeans have become more of a people with a stronger national identity, a greater propensity to participate in the decisions that affect the destiny of the country, and a wider range of views and voices on the future direction of Singapore, the challenges it confronts, and the strategies and means by which to achieve their preferred goal(s) for themselves, their children, and the country.

The nature, causes, and meaning of states of health and sickness is determined not only by physical symptoms but influenced by class, gender, and race, and is perceived differently by patients, practitioners, and policy-makers. Twentieth-century British authors such as Ian McEwan, A.S. Byatt, Ali Smith, James Kelman, David Lodge, and Will Self offer a cultural history of the present that is united by a particular concern with the myths and metaphors that contribute to our under-standing of health and sickness. Accordingly Literature and Medicine guides students through a series of literary texts that engage with contemporary issues of health and sickness and signal the inadequacy of any understanding of health that is not culturally, historically, and geographically situated. Literature and Medicine uncovers the ways in which twentieth-century British authors urge us to reclaim the narrative of the individual sick person and reconsider what it means to be healthy and what it means to be sick in the twenty-first century.\n\nSociological readings on the history and philosophy of medicine that signal the inadequa-cy of any understanding of health that is not culturally, historically and geographically sit-uated.\n\nNovels concerned with the myths and metaphors that contribute to our understanding of health and sickness. \n\nMaterial from the emergent field of the medical humanities including anthropology and cultural studies, literature and applied linguistics, performing arts, visual art, and creative practices with a focus on healing and recovery.\n\nSupplementary material on approaches to delivering humanities into healthcare and the requirement for practice based evidence."

Encoun- ters with the uncarmy/unheimlich (unhomely) and the abject in these texts unveil deep- seated anxieties regarding race, gender, class, and power, and these are collated with the way that the gothic reconfigures or destabilizes identity, especially as it relates to larger notions of nationhood, history, and belonging.

As a concept, we trace the theoretical understanding of the human from humanism, transhumanism to posthumanism.  As a lived reality, we consider our place in the shifting relations between the human, the nonhuman and our environments. \n\nBy close reading selected films, literary works and critical writings, we will explore encounters between the humanities and the sciences to rethink our relationship with our immediate reality. Our central question is: What does it mean to be human in the face of rapid technological advances, digitalization, climate change and the destruction of biodiversity?"

We will discuss new research that compares and contrasts both adult and child neural cognitive neuroplasticity.  For example, it is now known that neurogenesis occurs throughout life, and that areas of the brain formally devoted to one modality can be quickly recruited for processing a second modality when circumstances require. This class will review behaviors that can lead to increased neurogenesis and changes in neural connectivity. In its first 50 years, cognitive psychology has focused on defining general limits in perception, attention, memory, and reasoning.  We will discuss how experience, in some cases, allows these limits to be overcome, and in other cases cannot modify inherent cognitive restraints. In particular, we will evaluate the effectiveness of ?brain training? programs."

In the course, we will study the historical development of modern art in the region, with a special focus on the plural interactions that fuelled transformations in artistic expression during this period, and the ways in which art selectively adapted and refracted aesthetics, techniques and ideas found in art from other parts of the world. The interactions include intra-regional exchanges, for example between Islamic communities in Southeast Asia; as well as extra-regional exchanges, including with East and South Asia, the Arab World, and also with the colonial powers of Western Europe and North America. Together, we will critically examine competing narratives about the development of modern art in Southeast Asia. The course is an intermediate-level course which lays a basis for your further studies and professional endeavours in fields related to modern art (including, for example: contemporary art, curatorial studies, museum studies, art criticism and art history). Building on your knowledge of premodern Western and Asian art, this course seeks to introduce you to key artistic expressions of modernity and modernism in Southeast Asia, and to the interactions between modernity and colonialism as expressed in and shaped by art. In the course you will be engaged in thinking critically about competing narratives of the development of modern art in Southeast Asia."

In addition, the course develops a comparative understanding of the diversity of societal forms and cultural traditions in human history, especially the key features of modern life and its continued transformation in contemporary times."

First, social problems are constituted through human interaction. Second, social problems are socially defined and thus the meaning and significance of social problems may be contested. There are some social problems that pose practical (if different) challenges for us all. This course introduces sociological perspectives on social problems relating to poverty and inequality, work and occupations, social welfare, and the constitution and role of government."

With the help of several concepts and principles, the life course perspective helps us understand how societies and individuals change over time. It gives us a framework to examine various factors (e.g., historical, social) that affect us as we grow older; both in the continuities of life, and in the twists/turns that may happen to us along the way. It shows us that our lives are interconnected, but also that disparities between social groups can grow over time. In addition, we will briefly explore some methodological tools that can help us evaluate these processes. The class schedule is divided into three broad parts. In the first part of the course, we will learn about the key principles of the life course perspective and how they can be applied empirically. In the second part, we will explore different drivers of societal change over time, and learn to discriminate between them. Finally, in the third part, we will explore select topics that are crucial to life course analysis, such as the integration of biomarkers in life course research."

A different way of putting it: In this course, we will survey philosophers' failures at locating a plausible moral theory. The best way to devise a plausible moral theory is by starting with ideas that seem to lie at the heart of morality and then seeing if they can provide systematic and plausible answers to our moral questions. Some think that making the world as good as you can lies at the heart of morality. Some think giving people the respect they deserve lies at the heart of morality. Some think that being a good person lies at the heart of morality.

        "description": "Feynman famously wrote that 'I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics. ... Do not keep saying to yourself, if you can possibly avoid it, `But how can it be like that?'  because you will get `down the drain', into a blind alley from which nobody has yet escaped. Nobody knows how it can be like that.' But that seems like a perfect question for philosophers -- and some physicists -- who want to know what quantum mechanics is (or isn't) telling us about the world: how can it be like that? For instance, is Schrodinger's cat really 'dead and alive'? And what does it mean for it to 'become' dead or alive when we 'observe' it?\nTo tackle this question, we will study the foundations of quantum mechanics. We start by understanding the 'bare formalism' of quantum mechanics at a conceptual and logical level, and the crucial experiments in support of this formalism over the classical picture. We then consider three questions at the core of this formalism: the measurement problem, the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen argument for non-locality, and Bell's theorem. We will then study 'the standard picture' to quantum mechanics: the so-called Copenhagen interpretation, and an emphasis on measurement and instrumentalism, diagnosing some conceptual worries with this picture. We then turn to three robust families of proposals for approaching quantum mechanics and its ontology: the Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber (GRW) theory, Bohmian mechanics, and the many-worlds interpretation. In so doing, we engage with philosophical questions about locality, determinism, the dimensionality of fundamental space, underdetermination of theory by data, scientific realism, the arrow of time, the meaning of quantum probabilities, among others.\nThere is no formal prerequisite for the course, though a high school or undergraduate background in physics will be helpful. A tolerance for math is important, however, as we'll dive into physics. Every effort will be made to present the math and physics as cleanly and accessibly as possible. Students without technical backgrounds can and do thrive in this course, so long as math anxiety is left behind."

Systems Thinking is a dialectical way of thinking that relates real-world needs and problems to idealized conceptual models in order to explore and develop viable solutions. A systemic approach is adopted that emphasizes both logic and culture, as in human behaviour, in problem solving. It recognises that the world is a set of highly interconnected technical and social entities which are hierarchically organised producing emergent properties.  Systems Thinking is an essential skill for Systems Engineers which is shared with many disciplines and provides a key intellectual underpinning for Systems Engineering and program management.\n\nModule 2 provides first a conceptual-level description of Systems Engineering discipline. It then follows up with application aspects of the systems engineering processes and practices that relate to the life cycle development and management of an engineered system.  The course aims to provide an overview of how a quality engineered system is developed based broadly on an extended life-cycle model from defining a business case, addressing stakeholders? needs and requirements, developing systems requirements, functional and physical architecture, to systems design and build, systems integration and verification, and final validation and acceptance.  \n\nThis course also gives emphasis to the interdependency between Systems Engineering and Program Management, with both disciplines enabled by Systems Thinking and methodologies. Teaching cases will be used to illustrate the economic, technical and programmatic benefits of applying systems thinking and systems engineering practices in the planning, development and deployment of complex products and systems.  \n\nA special topic will be introduced to gain an appreciation of the strategy and architecture of Industry 4.0. A system of systems perspective will be encouraged to gain additional insights of this 4th Industrial Revolution and how it will shape the future of manufacturing."

        "description": "This course aims to introduce you to the fundamental concepts of game theory and mechanism design. Game theory, besides being of fundamental mathematical interest, is a main tool to model economic and strategic situations and then study the behavior of rational agents in such situations. Mechanism design is the study of how to design games (such as auctions) so that agents have incentive to act in a desirable way, e.g. by telling the truth. This course will improve your ability to model and analyze economics situations in a mathematical way. We will study the way rational agents will play games, based on their assumptions about the rationality of other agents. We will learn about the concept of Nash equilibria, which are solutions to games that no rational agent has an incentive to deviate from, and learn how to compute these. \nIn the second part of the course we turn to the problem of social choice, namely choosing from a set of alternatives, given the preferences of a set of players. We will see that many desirable properties of social choice functions cannot be satisfied, and then turn to ways to deal with this issue. The first way is to introduce payments and money-valued preferences, which leads to auction theory and related topics. Here students will learn how to design auctions and other economic mechanisms so that players have no incentive to lie, and to learn how to compute expected revenues. Secondly, we will consider mechanisms that do not allow payments, and study the ways manipulations by the players can be limited in this case. In the second part of the course students will learn how to design economic mechanisms that have certain properties (if possible), and how to judge economic mechanisms, as well as to apply Bayesian reasoning to compute expected outcomes.\nThe course is aimed at 3rd and 4th year students interested in economics, mathematical modelling, and applied math in general."

Although this approach may be intuitive due to its physical setup, it tends to give the wrong impression that wave functions are fundamental objects in QM. In actual fact, wave functions are just the different representations of the state (ket in Dirac notation) of the system. One can always choose other representations or even not choose a representation.\n \nThis course aims to unteach wave mechanics and free you of particular representations and work with the formalism directly.  You will explore the logical development of Quantum Mechanics (QM) formalism and develop QM systematically from finite to infinite dimensions in three parts. \n \nPart 1 aims to give a complete and systematic run-down of basic quantum kinematics and quantum dynamics so that you have a working understanding of quantum mechanics for finite-dimensional and infinite dimensional systems. The concept of measurement will also be covered. This provides probabilistic results for experiments.\n \nPart 2 aims to discuss symmetry within QM. Rotational symmetry (angular momentum is the generator of rotations) is the main and very important example. The rotational symmetry in Hydrogenic atoms will also be discussed, which will also introduce you to 3D QM.\n \nPart 3 adds on to the formalism for systems that cannot be solved exactly. These are real-life QM examples and the standard method to solve these systems is via perturbation for time-independent/dependent and non-degenerate/degenerate systems."

        "description": "The operations function in an organization is responsible for the design, control, and improvement of systems concerned with the production and delivery of goods and services. Because operations account for a significant portion of value added and cost in any business, even a small advantage in operations can mean the difference between winning and losing in a competitive marketplace. Beyond its internal operational processes, an organization can further create value by exploring other entities either upstream or downstream in its supply chain. Supply chain management is a set of approaches utilized to efficiently integrate suppliers, manufacturers, warehouses, and retail stores and to efficiently manage material, information and financial flows so that merchandise is produced and distributed at the right quantities, to the right locations, and at the right time, in order to maximize system-wide surplus. In this course, students will learn about operations strategy, and how it supports corporate strategy or how it inspires business model innovation. They will learn how to measure, analyze and design processes, which are critical to operational excellence. Subsequently, they will learn how to optimally leverage on the drivers of facilities, inventory, transportation, information, sourcing and pricing in order to address the complexity, uncertainty, dynamic environment, and fragmented ownership inherent in supply chains. In the process, the course will cover the success stories of Amazon's centralization, Walmart's cross-docking, Hewlett-Packard's postponement, Dell's modular design, Timbuk2's mass customization, Sport Obermeyer's quick response, Barilla's vendor-managed inventory, Ford's flexible manufacturing, and Blockbuster's revenue-sharing contract."

        "title": "STRATEGIC MARKETING",
        "institution": "NTU",
        "description": "Consider the following examples:\n1. In the early 2000s, Volkswagen AG, one of the largest automobile manufacturers in the world, decided to enter the luxury car market by introducing a top-of-the-line limousine-grade car named the Phaeton. Not only did the company embarked on an ambitious R&D project to construct a superbly-engineered car along demanding specifi cations, it also built a dedicated factory in a German town called Dresden, a town known for classical traditions and the arts, to manufacture the car. At the magnificent glass-walled factory, a team of craftsmen would hand-assemble each Phaeton car and fi t its interior with the finest, carefully-chosen wood and leather materials. The Volkswagen Phaeton was to be a masterpiece, and an object of desire for the discerning luxury car buyer, as the company envisioned. However, when the car was launched, sales were so poor that the company had to withdraw it from the US, a key international market. Until 2018 when the model was finally discontinued, the number of units sold around the world remained so low that the Phaeton project never made profit.\n2. In 1960, Japan's leading watch manufacturer Seiko Watch Corporation decided to prove its capability to make the highest quality watches that would parallel or even surpass the globally-acclaimed Swiss quality. The company introduced the Grand Seiko, the first precision-grade watch manufactured in Japan. Every Grand Seiko watch was tested to meet the most stringent standards for accuracy, and its casing was polished by hand to mirror finish, while its hands and hour markers gave a 'brilliant sparkle'. The Grand Seiko was also marketed as a luxury item, sold in dedicated corners of Seiko boutiques and priced significantly higher than other lines of Seiko watches. However, today, more than 60 years after the Grand Seiko was launched, not many consumers (especially outside of Japan) know that Seiko makes luxury watches, let alone the Grand Seiko brand. Moreover, in most markets around the world, Grand Seiko cannot be found in most independent luxury watch retail stores. And not many pre-owned watch dealers and auction houses would regard Grand Seiko as a collectible item that deserves a high valuation.\n3. In 2014, BlackBerry Limited, the troubled Canadian smartphone maker, introduced the BlackBerry Passport, an innovatively-designed phone that was proclaimed as the product that would help the company turn around its performance and become once again a popular consumer smartphone brand which it once was. Unlike most other smartphones in the market, the BlackBerry Passport, shaped like a Canadian passport (hence its name), had a large square screen and a physical keyboard. In its advertising, taglined 'Serious Mobility for Serious Business', BlackBerry showed how the phone would allow important people to make big decisions by seeing the big picture (with a big phone screen). The Passport was also portrayed as a tough and durable phone. The design featured a reinforced stainless steel frame inspired by a steel I-beams used in modernist building architecture. To date, however, BlackBerry never sold sufficient quantities of the Passport (or any other phone in its product line-up) to restore its previous glorious market standing. In fact, it is unclear what product strategy BlackBerry would adopt going forward to compete and survive in the fi ercely contested smartphone market.\nThe three examples above illustrate a fundamental truth in business: having a good product does not guarantee market success. How then can a company secure a high market share and achieve brand leadership? A great part of the answer lies in MARKETING. In the case of Volkswagen, the Phaeton car, despite its superior specification and fine craftsmanship, lacked a luxury brand appeal (since the brand Volkswagen itself means 'people's car' in German). The Grand Seiko, so closely associated with the mass-market Seiko brand, not only lacked a luxury brand appeal, but was also not well advertised and not well distributed especially outside of Japan, leading to low brand recognition and limited retail presence. Likewise, the Blackberry Passport, despite its interesting product design, was not perceived as a 'cool' phone, compared to the products that market leaders Apple and Samsung offered. Surely, business leadership requires a more enlightened understanding of marketing strategy.\n\nThe purpose of this course is to foster a strategic marketing mindset among you, the Renaissance Engineering students, future leaders of industry and the technological visionaries, so as to help you thrive in your careers. This course provides an experiential learning environment in which you will gain not only an appreciation but also a personal feel for the tasks of strategic marketing planning and decision making. Within this environment, you will learn to become an effective business decision maker with a market-oriented perspective, one who is capable of minimizing (though not completely removing) the uncertainties surrounding marketing decisions through disciplined analysis and prudent judgment. In this course, you do not just read about marketing strategy formulation; you practice it! And you do not just talk strategy recommendation; you execute it (and be accountable for the result of it)!"

        "description": "The object-oriented paradigm to the design of software is one major successful approach to address complexity and maintainability issues in software systems. We want students to establish an object-oriented mindset and to gain valuable insights into how software can be developed using the object-oriented approach. This course should not be interpreted to be a pure programming language course. Rather, the programming language serves to illustrate, via practical examples, the concepts learnt in the course. As a student of this course, you will learn essential object-oriented concepts such as encapsulation, the separation of design from implementation; the use of inheritance and polymorphism. You will discover how to describe these concepts using appropriate UML diagrams. Finally, you will also learn good design principles for reuse, and to realise these principles using object-oriented programming languages such as Java."
