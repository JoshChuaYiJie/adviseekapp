        "institution": "SMU",
        "description": "The single most challenging communication task in corporate and public life is persuasion, influencing others to understand, accept, and act on an often divergent viewpoint.  COMM330, Persuasion: The Business of Influence introduces you to the essentials of such effective influence. \n\nThis course asks some key questions about a complex and fascinating process: What makes some people so influential? What appeals to listeners: logic or emotion? How can I tell when someone is trying to deceive me? Why are some people especially susceptible to persuasive attempts?  How do mass influence conditions, like public policy campaigns, differ from how one gains compliance from individuals? \n\nBy discovering what is known in the last 50 years of research about persuasion, students will engage in applying persuasion concepts and strategies to creating more thoughtful and ethical persuasive messages and the right contextual conditions to promoting more effective persuasion. They will also become more discriminating receivers of persuasive messages."

Great theories are limited if they cannot be tested through empirical research. Research areas prosper partly because of the quality of the research methods, and progress partly because of innovation in research methods. This course seeks to provide a broad overview of research methods in the social and behavioural sciences at the graduate level. The course will focus on different types of research methods, such as lab experiments, field experiments, and survey research. In addition, it will discuss a variety of relevant issues such as philosophy of science, developing research questions and hypotheses, the relation between theory and empirical research, and research ethics. This course is meant to help students be in a position to make informed choices about designing and conducting their own research studies effectively and ethically. This course is about “generating data”, not analysing them. Thus, it complements other courses on data analysis and statics. This course is about research methods, not theory construction. Thus, it complements other courses on theory construction."

        "description": "Steve Jobs, a master at pitching, once said, “The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.” Successful pitching, whether to investors, superiors, or other decision makers, involves a healthy mix of “crazy belief”, confidence and risk-taking. For this reason, pitching can be both incredibly terrifying and exhilarating at the same time. \n\nUnderstanding the fundamentals as well as the mechanics of pitching will take you far towards successfully pitching your ideas. And there’s nothing like good, old-fashioned practice with plenty of feedback from peers and experts to help you hone your pitching skills. In this course, we will explore the fundamentals and mechanics of effective pitches and put into practice everything we are learning week by week towards becoming successful pitchers. \n\nWhile many people think of pitching as only useful for those who need to raise money (for example, a start-up pitch), pitching is actually an essential skill for reaching agreement on almost any subject. Agreement can yield many outcomes: management buy-in for developing a product or service, closing a sale, securing a partnership, recruiting an employee, securing an investment, and even securing employment for yourself. \n\nNancy Duarte, a communication specialist, put it this way: “Companies are started, products are launched, climate systems are saved – possibly based on the quality of presentations. Likewise, ideas, endeavours, and even careers can be cut short due to ineffective communication.” In this course, you will be given a good foundation for successful pitching so that no worthy idea or endeavour of yours will fall short simply because it wasn’t effectively conveyed."

Yet, most communication efforts in organisations tend to be directed externally. Internal communication is often misunderstood and is generally assumed as unnecessary as employees are expected to accept and comply. Recognising the importance of internal communication begins with the acknowledgement that organisations comprise sentient, thinking and diverse individuals who might not be readily agreeable and invariably obliging. Internal communication is fundamental as it can enable organisations to align missions and goals, cultivate common beliefs, coordinate activities, develop a shared identity and facilitate decision-making. Through project work with an external partner organisation and a variety of experiential in-class activities, this SMU-X course invites students to synthesise theories, frameworks and best practices from industry to address real-life business challenges affected by internal communication."

        "description": "Managing employee communication is a must-learn skill in today’s constantly changing work environment that is highly matrixed, virtual, and across borders and cultures. When leaders master this critical skill, they are able to unlock the secrets of employee engagement. Jack Welch, former CEO of General Electric and business consultant, even lists employee engagement as the number one measure of a company’s health.\n\nIn this hands-on and practical course, you will be taught frameworks for enhancing employee communication. This course explores the power of engaging employees, and the tools and tactics required to create an inspired and connected employee community for driving a successful organizational strategy. You will comprehend how to establish a clear line-of-sight between employee contributions and organizational success. You will also learn how to create trust and build personal connections, discover the elements of successful leadership, and be exposed to frameworks that will provide guidance as to how to develop an impactful and results-driven communication strategy, and gain exposure to practical examples as well as learn from cases. \n\nAs you go through this process of learning, you will understand what it means to be an engaged employee. You will learn how to use participatory, collaborative and strategic tools to influence management approaches to employee communication. Before you become a leader, and even when you are a leader, you are first and foremost an employee. Since communication is a two-way process, both the leader and the employee need to comprehend the rules of engagement – this is what the course will impart – a toolkit for effective employee communication in today’s project-centered, matrixed, or virtual organizations.\n\nTo hone your learning, you will be asked to practice what you learn by participating in a capstone project in which you will develop an employee communication plan for an assigned company."

        "description": "If management is like slaying monsters, change management compares to fighting monstrous hordes. Firstly,  because the specific change situation is often unique and therefore outside management´s comfort zone. Secondly, because change can only be successful if all stakeholders (investors, employees, media etc.) support the process. Change operations fail often enough and become crises. Therefore true change leaders are also true communicators (or get their advice) – involving and persuading multiple and often conflicting stakeholder groups. Since change has become commonplace in business, change communication is today a pivotal function of leadership.\n\nThis case-based course aims to prepare students for the handling of communications during the most regular change processes: mergers & acquisitions; restructuring & divestments; turn-around programmes; corporate scandals (actual or perceived)."

Second, it is to develop a deep understanding of macroeconomic phenomena such as business cycles, long-term economic growth, and the process of economic development, as well as macroeconomic policy issues, such as the impact of fiscal and monetary policy on the economy and the design of a social security system or an unemployment insurance scheme.\nThis first part of the sequence first covers the topic of measurement of macro-economic variables, before easing students into micro-founded macroeconomics by developing a static general equilibrium model with production and using it to analyze a number of fiscal policy issues. The course then moves on to a dynamic\nframework and covers the mechanics of long-term economic growth and the role of policy in economic development. Students are then introduced to dynamic decision problems when considering consumption and savings decisions of households and investment decisions of firms, and these building blocks are combined with a Walrasian approach to the labor market to complete the development of a dynamic macroeconomic model, which is then used to consider fiscal policy questions like the role of the timing in taxes and government expenditures."

The course will then unpack the model part by part, both theoretically and empirically, for a more nuanced understanding of growth. Its ingredients such as human capital formation will be studied. Its assumption of perfect institutions will be examined with a particular focus on property rights, corruption, and financial development. The causal impact of institutions on growth will be explored. Finally growth theory will be revisited to see how poverty traps arise as a result of imperfect institutions leading to emergence and persistence of poor economic outcomes. The course will end with an introduction to political economy of development where we will explore reasons why inefficient policies are often chosen."

Wealth management is to grow, preserve, and transfer wealth to future generations. The traditional focus in investment management has primarily been on institutions. However, with the large growth in private wealth globally and particularly in Asia, wealth management for HNWIs is fast emerging. The course begins with a macro view on the wealth management landscape before advancing to understand the similarities and differences between managing wealth for institutions versus for individuals. With individuals, we will appreciate the need for different investment products and wealth solutions across client segments based on needs and suitability. Students will learn how to risk profile a client using behavioural finance knowledge and models, prepare an investment policy statement (IPS) for a particular client’s profile and be able to suggest an asset allocation based on the IPS. As the life cycle stages of a client progresses, the wealth advisory approach must incorporate retirement planning. Students will learn the iterative wealth management and advisory process where client profiling, monitoring and review of investment portfolios, implementation and executions of the investment plans are conducted regularly and dynamically across the life cycle stages of a client.\n\nEthical behaviour builds trust. We will examine ethical conduct in the investment advisory process and the corporate governance process of banks to encourage ethical behaviour of client advisors. Last but not least, we will introduce sustainability investing as a preference in client’s IPS and how to approach ESG requirements of the client."

This prompts the question: Why are some countries rich and others poor? From around 1870 until the Second World War, Japan’s income per capita remained around 25 percent of U.S. income per capita. After the substantial reforms put in place at the end of the war, Japanese relative income rose sharply so that today Japanese standard of living is roughly two-thirds that of the U.S. level. The rapid catch-up was also achieved in the post-war period by several other Asian economies including Singapore. What is it that makes it possible for countries to produce growth miracles? For much of world history, people lived at subsistence levels well described by Thomas Malthus. Around the nineteenth century, however, there was an escape from Malthusian stagnation beginning in Europe. What is the engine of economic growth? Gasoline contributes to air pollution as it powers our cars. The release of carbon dioxide as oil and gasoline are burned contributes to global warming. What is the relationship between economic growth and environmental quality? These are the questions that we will pursue in this course."

In Singapore, where many key financial decisions are supported by government programmes, the ability to navigate complex systems has always been key. For example, investing and retirement planning involve a grasp of the country’s personal income tax system and the CPF system, while homebuying requires understanding the HDB system and mortgage borrowing. Health insurance choices are centered around the basic provisions of Medishield in combination with a range of options around private providers.\n\nThe scope of financial literacy is being redefined, both in Singapore and elsewhere, especially as societies begin to recognize the need for finance to be more inclusive and sustainable. The introduction of new enablers also introduces new risks, particularly in the instance of financial technology (fintech). For instance, as fintech unlocks unprecedented access to new services (such as robo advisors, buy-now-pay-later) and products (such as sustainable or “green” investment funds), it becomes increasingly important to ensure that consumers are sufficiently well-informed or otherwise protected.\n\nThis SMU-X course offers an experiential learning opportunity that allows students to translate classroom knowledge about financial literacy into practical solutions for real organizations that represent the forefront of financial innovation.  The course will focus on initiatives related to building individual financial literacy with respect to new goals and financial services in the context of each organization’s current or future business model.  Through this student consultancy project, students will learn how to solve complex business problems related to financial literacy, inclusion, and fintech, with guidance from the faculty and project sponsor mentors, from problem definition to final client presentation–while simultaneously testing their skills in real world settings."

It covers fundamental principles developed in economics to understand the functioning/workings of an urban economy and the various aspects of urban life. Firstly, the course begins with the definition of a city, and why cities form by introducing the economics of agglomeration, and how cities interact to form the urban system of the entire economy. These factors affect all urban phenomena. Secondly, the course analyzes the internal spatial structure of a city by developing a theory of commuting, housing demand and housing production. It then analyzes transportation and land/housing issues in more detail. On transportation, we focus on the economics of traffic congestions, the rationale for congestion pricing (ERP), and the so-called fundamental law of highway congestion. The discussion on land and housing, will address various housing phenomena such as tenure choice and location. The courses will discuss the optimality of local public good provision, and connect local public finance and housing markets with land taxation. Finally, the course addresses the economics of urban planning to comprehend various urban forms that are found in different cities in the world. It will highlight key aspects of Singapore’s urban policies, such as the ERP and the Land Acquisition Act 1973. The topics for group projects cover many other urban policies in Singapore and its comparison with other countries, including but not limited to Singapore’s master plans."

ESG risk management is increasingly vital for companies due to several compelling reasons:\n\n1. Reputation and Brand Value: Companies with strong ESG practices are perceived more positively by consumers, investors, and other stakeholders. Managing ESG risks helps protect and enhance a company's reputation and brand value, reducing the risk of negative publicity and boycotts.\n\n2. Regulatory Compliance: Governments and regulatory bodies are imposing stricter ESG-related regulations. Effective ESG risk management ensures compliance with these regulations, avoiding fines, legal action, and operational disruptions.\n\n3. Investor Demand: Investors are increasingly considering ESG factors in their investment decisions. Companies that manage ESG risks well attract more investment and often benefit from lower capital costs. ESG performance is now a key metric for many institutional investors and funds.\n\n4. Operational Efficiency and Cost Savings: Managing environmental risks can lead to more efficient resource use, waste reduction, and energy savings. Social and governance improvements can enhance employee satisfaction and productivity, reducing turnover and associated costs.\n\n5. Risk Mitigation: ESG risks, such as climate change impacts, social unrest, and governance failures, can have significant financial and operational impacts. Proactively managing these risks helps companies avoid or mitigate potential losses and disruptions.\n\n6. Competitive Advantage: Companies that excel in ESG risk management often have a competitive edge. They are better positioned to anticipate and adapt to market changes, meet stakeholder expectations, and capitalize on new business opportunities related to sustainability and ethical practices.\n\n7. Long-Term Sustainability: ESG risk management supports the long-term sustainability of a company by addressing the broader impacts of its operations on the environment, society, and its governance structure. This holistic approach ensures the company can thrive in the future while contributing positively to the world.\n\nThis course will investigate how ESG risk considerations can be integrated into a company’s wider Enterprise Risk Management Frameworks.  Focus here will be on Environmental Risk considerations (Climate Change and Nature/Biodiversity), given the importance and regulatory focus that these attract."

Despite growing recognition of this imperative and increasing corporate commitments to decarbonisation, most of these commitments lack detailed and credible plans. Achieving net zero emissions by 2050 will require a fundamental transformation of the global economy, particularly in the energy and hard-to-abate sectors that contribute the most to global emissions. This transition demands significant investment, estimated at US$3-4 trillion per year, necessitating substantial scaling and deployment of both private and public sector capital.\n\nThis course delves into decarbonisation pathways and key climate transition strategies within the energy and hard-to-abate sectors, equipping students with the knowledge and skills to assess credible transition planning and articulate key decarbonisation challenges and growth opportunities in the emergence of new clean technologies. The course also highlights the wider policy landscape and how significant government policies can influence the development of low-carbon products and their supply chains. Additionally, it explores various funding structures to finance companies’ decarbonisation strategies, the meaning of sustainable business, and the need for companies to transition in a financially sustainable manner.\n\nBy the end of this course, students will understand the challenges and opportunities associated with reducing carbon emissions in traditionally difficult-to-decarbonise sectors such as cement, steel, fossil fuel energy, and transport. They will gain foundational knowledge necessary for finance professionals to assess the viability and impact of decarbonisation and climate transition strategies. Students will learn about the technical processes and commercial viability of decarbonisation technologies, such as carbon capture and storage, energy efficiency improvements, and alternative fuels like hydrogen, as well as geographical considerations, national circumstances, and geopolitical factors. The course will also cover the role of international cooperation, government policies, and private sector initiatives in driving decarbonisation. By the end of the course, students will be equipped to contribute to the development and implementation of effective decarbonisation strategies, fostering a low-carbon future for Asia's most challenging sectors.\n\nThe course is structured to provide a comprehensive understanding of the various aspects of decarbonisation and climate transition strategies. This includes analysis of viable pathways to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, focusing on the energy and hard-to-abate sectors; exploration of technologies such as carbon capture and storage, energy efficiency improvements, and alternative fuels; examination of significant government policies and their impact on the development of low-carbon products and supply chains; an overview of different funding mechanisms to support decarbonisation efforts; discussion on the importance of financially sustainable transitions for businesses; and practical examples and case studies to illustrate successful decarbonisation strategies and initiatives. This course is designed to provide students with a well-rounded understanding of the critical issues and innovative solutions in the quest to reduce carbon emissions and transition to a low-carbon economy."

Students will learn how to: (a) manage data with the R programming language; (b) collect data from social media (i.e. Twitter) and a web-search volume indicator (i.e.Google Trends); (c) conduct sentiment analysis; (d) perform a statistical technique to enhance brand positioning (i.e. multi-dimensional scaling), and; (e) visually display data in order to gain insights, to aid managerial decisions in a competitive environment.\n\nNOTE: There is a reason for scheduling this course at the beginning of the MCM program with classes over five consecutive days. This is a hard-skill course in which students will learn about R coding languages for data analytics and visualization. It is expected that students have no background in R programming; however, it is essential for students to practice both during and after the 5-day course period the programming skills they have learned in order to fully grasp the course content. Analogously, learning R programming is like learning how to play the piano—hands-on practice with R programming is of critical importance in learning the course content. To ensure and pace student learning throughout the course, there will be four in-class hands-on lab assessments (three group-based; one individual-based)."

By changing the environment where everyday decisions are made, you can encourage people toward choices that are in their best interests. \n\nIn organizational settings, managers often rely on personal experiences, anecdotes, and/or organizational beliefs to execute strategies aimed at having an impact. This course discusses ways in which influence strategies that may appeal on an intuitive level can be challenged and better informed by behavioral sciences, and, in turn, be transformed in order to create a competitive edge.\n\nStudents will apply key scientific principles to learn how and why suboptimal decisions are reached in business and public policy contexts. Approaching these real-world problems, this course will discuss research in the fields of social and cognitive psychology, consumer and organizational behavior, behavioral economics, and experimental political science related to how people make judgments and decisions. Along the way, students will learn how to design and test actionable interventions.\n\nThe course will be held over four days (two weekends), and include two Friday night sessions and two full-day Saturday sessions. To pace and facilitate students’ learning, the course is structured to include interactive lectures and hands-on tasks (team-based in-class exercises on improving real-world interventions on Day 2; comprehensive quiz on Day 3; group discussion on assigned readings on Day 4)."

Some  M&A transactions  are  pursued  for  strategic  reasons  –  to  improve  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency (synergistic) of the underlying business. M&A transactions could also be undertaken by management to pursue their own interests, such as managerial entrenchment, which would be value destroying to the shareholders. In the latter case, the market could intervene by punishing the management via the takeover market.\n\nThis course serves to familiarize participants with the nuances of the M&A market.   Specifically, it aims to explain the role that M&A play in corporate strategy development.  In this respect, some of the related questions will be explored: Why firms undertake these transactions?  What is the genesis of  value  in  these  transactions? How  much  value, if  any, is created? Who  gains  from  these transactions? What is the track record of value creation for M&A deals? How does M&A market relate to corporate restructuring?\n\nAn important focus is relating the theory to the practical aspect of a deal. Here, participants will be exposed to valuation techniques and issues; structuring considerations; aspects of M&A execution including negotiation strategies, due diligence, documentations, legal and regulatory issues. Post- acquisition integration which is a crucial part of M&A transactions will also be discussed.\n\nThis course will be relevant for those planning to pursue a career in finance or general management in a corporate setting as well as those planning to pursue a career in private equity or at a deal intermediary, such as an investment  bank.   As such, there will be some discussions on how an investment bank organizes its corporate finance department  and how this product fits with other parts of its capital raising business."

IMC combines qualitative understanding of consumers with large-scale analytics to develop communications and content that build and maintain strong brands. Grounded in advertising and direct media communications, IMC has emerged as the premier way for organizations to manage customer experiences in the digital age.\n\nIn this course, we will begin with the “IMC process” and help students to understand the linkages between business strategy, marketing strategy, customer lifetime value management, and marketing ROI.  We will share leading edge research from Medill’s Spiegel Research Center (spiegel.medill.northwestern.edu/), whose mission is to undertake evidence-based, data-driven analysis to prove the relationship between customer engagement and purchase behavior.  We will then look at the rapidly evolving landscape of marketing and communications technologies to understand how marketers use these technologies to enable more responsive customer journeys and more scalable and agile marketing processes.  We will spend time examining new emerging technologies for conversational marketing.\n\nThe course will include two field trips to companies using IMC concepts in innovative ways. \n\nThe course will conclude with group presentations focused on reimagining the customer journey in the context of the new media and technology environment.  Students will choose an industry, category, and/or brand.\n\nThe course will build on skills and knowledge that students will have developed in other SMU classes, including Marketing Management and Digital Marketing.\n\nThe final project (due post-class) will consist of two essay questions, one that is more of personal reflections on course learnings and another built around critiquing/developing a brand’s IMC strategy."

Indeed, organizations (operationalized as governments, corporate, not-for-profit, or even prominent individuals) are, literally, experiencing and battling crises of some form or other. This can be internal crises like miscommunication, personality clashes; to external crises like Covid-19, policy mismanagement, or terrorism. Due to the vulnerability of the organization to both internal and external uncertainties, no organization is immune from crises.\n\nWhile organizations recognize the probability of the occurrence of crises, studies have shown that many do not have any preparation or plan to deal with them. Some do not find it necessary to take preventive measures; others simply do not know where to begin, and what to do.\n\nThis course aims to equip leaders like you with the necessary skills and abilities to prepare for organizational crises, diagnose the nature of the crises, communicate during crises, and learn how to lead. The emphasis, thus, is on the preventive, rather than reactive, aspects of crisis management.\n\nScholars agree that crisis management is a dynamic, ongoing process, through a life cycle. You will be taken through each step of the life cycle of a crisis, with the aim of helping you learn what you need to do at each phase. While many scholars have posited different frameworks, for this course, Wilcox, Cameron and Reber’s (2015) proactive-strategic-reactive-recovery framework is adopted because of its emphasis on the preventive aspects."

Given the need to now use information technology to drive human relationships and community activities into a new age of digital civilization, corporate communication and public relations functions have found themselves in the front lines of continuously having to engage, support, motivate and communicate with multiple stakeholders on a global level. This course discusses why domestic public relations/communication do not exist anymore because of the international outreach of organisations in an age of digitalised globalisation. It aims to drive across the message that every communication professional must have a multicultural and global perspective in order to be effective, particularly if they hope to align communication with organisation’s business and growth strategies. It will also shed light on the need to comprehend sociocultural factors which are key in predicting adoption of strategies if local companies hope to build and grow their reputation worldwide. Designed for postgraduate students, this module demonstrates the importance of theory in informing practice and offers invaluable insights on the global best practices from top corporate communication leaders in an exciting new reality where the role of public relations is being expanded internationally and reshaped to drive business transformation endeavours."

        "description": "The economic environment provides many of the critical parameters for companies doing business in an increasingly integrated world. Economic expansion or recession will change all business forecasts; market structure will affect profitability; fluctuating exchange rates will have an impact on costs, sales, risk perceptions and debt levels; and the state of the national budget or interest-rate decisions can color a company ́s future. In particular, a global recession like the one suffered recently can transform consumption behavior and business strategies. Managerial Economics provides students with a framework to understand the main economic variables and dynamics that affect business activity. Understanding the microeconomy is the first stepping-stone toward achieving a full grasp of the economic world that surrounds us. Most of the world ́s countries rely on free markets to make most of their economic decisions, and those markets automatically answer the key economic questions (What will we produce? How will we produce it? At what price? Who will get it?) through the operation of supply and demand. The course will review the basic concepts of supply, demand, market failures and externalities to provide a broad perspective on how free markets work. It will then move on to elasticity and market structures and their impact on profitability. The objective is to give students a firm understanding of how supply and demand at the micro-level determine the basic parameters of doing business. Yet markets are not perfect. In our times, a period of deregulation and strong faith in markets to solve economic problems has been followed by the deepest economic crisis since the early 20th century, with devastating effects on output, income and employment nearly everywhere. The experience has brought back to the fore the key questions of how economic decisions should be made, and how much governments should intervene when market failures exist, especially in light of pressing problems such as environmental deterioration which the market appears poorly equipped to solve. The second part of the course will focus on the macroeconomy and the policies that governments follow, and how the interaction between free economic forces and policy affect the business cycle and company prospects. It will begin by analyzing the key macroeconomic indicators --GDP, inflation and unemployment and the business cycle--, and evaluate how changes in these variables affect businesses. It will then outline the dynamics of the macroeconomy, the operation of fiscal and monetary policies and how and why policy decisions are made, to give students the tools to anticipate key policy decisions and understand their impact on the macroeconomy. Finally, the course moves from the micro and national levels to the global level, for a look at international trade, exchange rates and the balance of payments. It will detail the forces of trade, the determinants of exchange rates, and the important concepts underlying the balance of payments; and how all of those elements of the international economy affect business. In the process, we will encounter an explanation for the Great Contraction that occurred beginning in 2008, and will be able to understand how the crisis has and will change our economic lives. A special focus will be given to the Asian markets to see their dynamics."

The course employs both a theoretical and an experiential learning approach with the aim of fulfilling the objectives as outlined below.\n\nStudents will gain knowledge and skills about leadership development and team-building skills based on theories, principles, concepts, application, exercises/class activities, self-assessments/instruments, and experiential learning. \n\nCentral to the course is the action-based and experiential Group Project Assignment that offers an opportunity for students to work in groups to collaborate with a non-profit organization or profit-based organization that upholds community development and/or corporate social responsibility or sustainability initiatives1, that is, they initiate and act as idea champions to contribute to community with a project of their own and approach beneficiaries along the way to amend or improve on their ideas. Students are also free to work with any profit and/or non-profit organization on an existing or new project they may have, provided such opportunities exist and are offered to students.  \n\nAs idea champions, students work in groups, to develop/invent a prototype/model or mobile application or put into place a process, program or plan such as a business plan that will value-add and contribute to the needs of the beneficiary or organization of their choice. It is entirely up to the leadership of the organization concerned whether they would consider implementing or not implementing what students have designed. In other words, there is no compulsion for any organization to eventually sponsor the proposed ideas to the organization(s) concerned or may be collaborating with.\n\nThe outcomes of the group project for students are outlined as follows:\n(i) Students will learn about leadership from the leaders they are connecting with. For example, they will learn how and why today’s leaders are engaged in community-based or social initiatives in Singapore and beyond. \n(ii) Students will also learn from the leaders lessons on leadership and/or teamwork based on the leaders’ experiences.\n(iii) By undertaking a hands-on group project, students will also learn practical lessons as well as the complexities of teamwork based on their OWN experience and process of working internally, with their group mates and externally, with organizations outside of school.\n(iv) Each student will also reflect on his/her own learning throughout the project from start to end as outlined below (see ‘Reflection Essay’ for details).\n(v) Students will also fulfill other learning objectives that include cognitive and academic development as outlined below in the section, ‘Learning Objectives’"

Second, multiple testing procedures: when many hypothesis tests are carried out at the same time (such as when evaluating the performance of a large number of fund managers), one needs to take the multiplicity into account in order to safeguard against the possibility of making false rejections / discoveries beyond the pre-specified significance level. Many such procedures exist, though not all well understood. Students will learn which procedures to use for which purposes. Third, we discuss performance hypothesis testing (such as for the equality of Sharpe ratios of two investment strategies) in the absence of strong and unrealistic parametric assumptions on financial data."

With proper data collection, preparation, analysis and modelling, insights can be achieved leading to better decision making and actions that create positive impact. Data analytics is divided into different levels namely, descriptive analytics, predictive analytics, prescriptive analytics and automated (or embedded) analytics.\n\nIn this course, students will acquire practical skills in modelling and analysis to resolve business problems using software tools including Excel and Tableau. Knowing how to effectively use these tools to build models and analyse data to solve problems will add tremendous value in our students’ future professional career.\n\nThis course’s primary focus is on using Excel spreadsheet as a platform to build mathematical models from scratch to represent business problems for detailed analysis. The use of such models to drive understanding and consensus towards generating insights and actions enhanced the assurance of execution success. With the data collected, data manipulation and transformation will be needed to prepare the data into useful forms for analysis. In terms of data analytics, this course will cover descriptive analytics, predictive analytics and prescriptive analytics, using both Excel and Tableau. In-class exercises would be used to present business problem modeling and analysis. Students would interactively develop the skills and experience to deal with open-ended questions, unclear assumptions and incomplete information.\n\nIn addition to the individual assessments (take-home assignments and in-class quizzes), a group project will allow students to apply the knowledge and skills acquired to solve a business problem of their choice end-to-end where they will define the business questions, collect the necessary data, build the models, perform the data analytics, to draw insights and conclusions."

Institutions differ from individuals as most of them are tax-exempt, unlike individuals who are subject to various taxes. In addition, institutions have much longer investment horizons than individuals. Finally, the objectives and constraints of individuals are more varied than institutions. Hence, the tools and issues for investment management for individuals need to be expanded.  \n\nThe formulation of an investment plan for retirement is used as a framework for discussing the various issues in investment management for individuals. Thus, we examine the key challenges and issues pertaining to ensuring that an individual has sufficient funds to live out his/her retirement years. Issues covered include taxation, asset allocation, insurance, annuities, pensions, housing, healthcare, demographics etc.\n\nAs this is an emerging area in finance, students will not be learning a well-established body of knowledge but would learn how to think about the issues. In short, there are no quick and easy answers, but rather many questions for us to explore."

Science and Technology Studies (STS) is the interdisciplinary study of how science and technology shape society and the environment, and conversely, how society and the environment shape science and technology. Innovation and maturation, systems and regulation, risk and failure are the key notions that exemplify this dynamic relationship. In this course, we will analyze what science is, how it works, and how society provides the means and framework for scientific and technological knowledge. We will draw from various perspectives in the humanities and social sciences, including those of history, anthropology, sociology and public policy to explore different forms of interaction between science, technology, and society. In other words, we will examine the connections between scientific theories and practices, and our social, cultural, economic, and political lives. Specific topics covered include nuclear power and waste, regulation of the internet, data and self-hood, as well as climate change politics. The first unit introduces central ideas in Science and Technology Studies (STS). In unit two, we focus on assumptions and authority of science and technology, asking who benefits from how particular research agendas or new technologies are designed, and who bears the risks of living with uncertain science or dangerous technologies. The final unit explores controversial issues in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), and examines how policy-makers, scientists and STS scholars have addressed conflict and controversy."

By 2015, its per capita income was US$56,000, similar to Germany and the US. Its economic journey began with its dependence on entrepot trade and heavy dependence on the expenditure of British bases. Today it is a global city state: a little red dot, but a global brand.\n\nSingapore is ranked by the World Bank as the easiest place in the world to do business and by the Heritage Foundation and the freest economy in the world, after Hong Kong. There are virtually no import tariffs, no export subsidies, no exchange restrictions, no price ceilings, no minimum wage, no rent control. Income tax rates are among the lowest in the world, and government expenditure as a percentage of GDP well below most countries.\n\nSingapore’s leadership over the last 50 years can best be described as innovative and entrepreneurial in their policy making. Like China, careful choice and grooming of political leaders plus an orderly succession have provided the political stability and confidence for investors, resulting in rising standards of living.\n\nSingapore’s policy approach is both pragmatic – an emphasis on what works in practice rather than abstract theory; and eclectic – a willingness to adopt best practices from around the world. Market principles and signals guide its policies such as industrial policy, medical insurance, congestion pricing, social security, regulation of utilities, or allocation of land. Nevertheless, its Government does not hesitate to intervene when markets fail. State-owned enterprises continue to exist and thrive but they are run on market principles and are not allowed endless State subsidies.\n\nWelfare programs exist but are minimal so that work incentives are not eroded. Housing, health and education are subsidized.\n\nGoing forward, Singapore faces substantial challenges: a rapidly aging population, the political necessity to limit immigrant workers, declining exports and productivity, loss of competitiveness and inequality. Its leaders are searching for a new paradigm of growth."

Climate has played a role in socio-political changes including the rise and fall of civilisations, to the shaping of socio-cultural traditions and customs. Second, it looks at the development of the science of climate and the meteorology. It explores climate science as a global phenomenon, influenced by scientific ideas and movements that circulated across borders and empires, but also as a response to local circumstances, especially extremes of weather. It also considers some of the broader challenges being faced because of climate change today and the role of the historian in current climate change debate. It has a particular focus on Asia and the exchange of knowledge about climate and weather between East and West."

It adopts interdisciplinary perspectives from science and technology studies, urban studies and urban planning, critical policy studies, geography, and sociology to evaluate the nature, scale, and effectiveness of these solutions to city challenges locally and globally. Drawing on case studies internationally as well as from Singapore, students will learn about: (a) different technological tropes of urban solutions; (b) the history and culture of technocratic problem-solving in the urban context; (c) the global capitalist landscape of urban solutions providers, in particular technology companies; and (d) Singapore’s peculiar standing as a self-styled, ideal-type ‘model’ of urban solutions, particularly for countries and cities in the Global South. Particular emphasis will be laid on the increasingly important role of technology companies as suppliers of ’solutions’ for urban challenges, as well as on critical perspectives of place, politics, and power, to continually ask questions of who has the power to define ‘problems’ and ‘solutions’.  Over thirteen weeks of readings, field-trips, and seminar discussions, students will learn to problematize and critically reflect on the contradictory conceptions of ‘solutions’ and ‘problems’ in the context of (global) metropolitan governance from the distinctive position of a putative ‘model’ city."

        "description": "This course provides students with a set of interweaving and interdisciplinary concepts across the social sciences regarding the what, the how and the why regarding the implementation of technology on urban sustainability issues. Topics to be covered include (i.) sustainability in cities, particularly in the context of environmental and climate change; (ii.) the role of technology in enhancing and disrupting “normal” ways of life in the city, through the use of shared riding/food delivery apps, and social media and (iii.) how technology applied judiciously can enhance liveability and livelihoods for a wide range of urban residents who are both technology-savvy and residents uncomfortable using technology. Students will gain an understanding of how selected industries consider and apply these technologies towards urban sustainability issues. While there will be some in-class meetings to discuss theoretical concepts, learning will be primarily experiential in nature through class discussion, group exercises, and a team project. Guest speakers with practical and industrial experience may be invited as well. The course project will work with one industry sponsor (Facebook Asia). Students are expected to conceive solution to address a defined problem statement, related to an aspect of urban sustainability with societal impact, and in accordance to the real-world needs of the industry sponsor."

Discussions about preparedness for an outbreak abound and systems of biological research, biomedical interventions, and global health measures are implemented to contain and resolve an outbreak. Governments and communities respond by suspending some privileges as scientists and institutions fast-track therapeutic solutions. While these events may feel “unprecedented,” epidemics have occurred in the past. The key is to understand what has changed and what has remained similar. This course examines epidemics from the perspectives of history of biomedicine, global health, and the life sciences. Understanding the history of epidemics will help us attain a comprehensive understanding about what epidemics actually are. This knowledge will also aid in our social responses to COVID-19 in our everyday lives, chart informed biomedical interventions and potential socio-political actions. We will explore questions such as, How have epidemics shaped society? How did the biomedical practices around epidemics arise? Are vaccines really the “magic bullet” to solve all of our problems?"

Do you think it changed the way people interact with one another? And when you look at it, does it give you hope or make you nervous about what may come? In this class, we will explore how technological artifacts and systems— from the ships early factories to the internet—have shaped (and are shaped by) social, cultural, economic, and political factors. The course’s underlying premise is that “technology”—a concept that carries a multifaceted ideological baggage—only makes sense when understood as being embedded in specific social, material, and ideological configurations. That is to say, there are histories of technologies. Instead of a comprehensive survey, the course will unfold through chronologically arranged topics that include the emergence of industrial society, imperial mobility, urban spectacles, systems of mass production, gendered consumption, digital cultures, risk in the Anthropocene, and technological imaginings. The unifying theme weaving all these topics together will be that far from being deterministic, technology is instead better understood as a site of contestation and negotiation for different visions of society. So that students can dig deeper into those tensions, each week will feature not only scholarly readings, but also two primary source-driven case studies in which groups will explore the complex intersection between technology and society—including Singaporean rickshaws, the Magnitogorsk Soviet industrial city, the contraceptive pill, and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. For their final project, students will select a technological artifact and write a historical essay about its development and/or use."

        "description": "Spatial econometrics consists of econometric techniques dealing with empirical problems (in regional science, economics, and social sciences) where “interactions” among geographical units, economic agents or social actors generate “spatial dependence” among cross-section units rendering classical econometric techniques invalid. Common spatial effects such as, neighbourhood effects, spillover effects, copy-catting, networks effects, and externalities, have received an increasing attention by applied researchers. Spatial econometric models and methods have been proved to be very effective tools in dealing with these issues. Applications are seen not only in specialized fields of regional science, urban economics, real estate and economic geography, but also increasingly in more traditional fields of economics and finance, including demand analysis, labour economics, public economics, international economics, agricultural and environmental economics, asset pricing model, and arbitrage pricing theory.\n\nSpatial econometric models extend classical econometric models by incorporating spatial lag, spatial error, and/or spatial Durbin terms to capture spatial dependence through spatial weight matrices and spatial coefficients. This course introduces the core set of spatial econometric models including spatial linear regression models, spatial panel data models, and spatial dynamic panel data models, and the associated methods of estimation and inference such as (quasi) maximum likelihood, M-estimation, and GMM. Common tests for spatial and/or dynamic effects, e.g., LM tests, standardized LM tests, and bootstrap LM tests are introduced. Empirical illustrations of the methods are presented using Matlab software."

However, epidemics and pandemics are not just biological phenomena—they are also intimately intertwined with society and culture. Throughout history different communities have found diverse ways to make sense of and tackle the rapid spread of disease. In turn, those intense experiences have shaped questions concerning rights and responsibilities, the boundaries of belonging, and risk and prevention. This course introduces students to the different ways humanists and social scientists have approached the study of communicable diseases in the modern era. It begins with discussions of how to talk about and how to frame this field of study, and then follows a loosely chronological structure—starting with nineteenth-century debates about the nature of cholera and ending with the complex relationship between emerging viruses and globalization. On the way we explore how tropical diseases helped shape and were shaped by colonialism; the networks that connect diseases, vectors, and populations; the fraught history of vaccine resistance; the massive mobilization in response to the devastating 1918 influenza pandemic; and the way stigma and activism has defined the HIV/AIDS pandemic."

        "institution": "SMU",
        "description": "This course consists of two parts: Panel Data Analysis (Part I) and Spatial Econometrics (Part II).\n\nPart I covers models and methods for analyzing panel and longitudinal data that arise from repeated measurements taken from a cross-section of subjects. These models have found substantive applications in social and biological sciences where the describer “panel” and “longitudinal” respectively arose. This course is primarily oriented to applications in social sciences including business, economics, education, sociology, etc. Major topics include (i) panel data models with individual-specific effects (fixed, random, or correlated random); (ii) panel data models with both individual- and time-specific effects, (iii) panel data models with heteroskedasticity and serial correlation, (iv) tests of hypotheses with panel data models, and (v) dynamic panel data models. Major inference methods such as (quasi) likelihood and GMM will be introduced. Throughout, we emphasize on models, methods and their applications with computer software STATA or R software.\n\nPart II covers models and methods for analyzing spatial data or spatial panel data. The term ‘spatial’ comes from the fact that cross-sectional (spatial) dependence exists among the spatial units so that the regular econometric methods are no longer valid for analyzing these data. Spatial dependence (or social interaction or network effect) often exists among economic agents (or geographical units or social actors), in the forms of neighbourhood effects, peer effects, copy-catting, and externalities. It has received an increasing attention by regional scientists, urban economists, econometricians, statisticians, etc. Spatial econometric models and methods have been proved to be effective tools in dealing with issues related to spatial dependence. Applications are seen not only in specialized fields of regional science, urban economics, real estate and economic geography, but also increasingly in more traditional fields of economics and finance, including demand analysis, labour, public, international, agricultural and environmental, asset pricing, and arbitrage pricing.\n\nMajor topics in this part includes (i) spatial linear regression models, (ii) spatial panel data models, (iii) spatial models with unknown heteroskedasticity, (iv) spatial dynamic panel data models, and (v) tests for spatial and/or dynamic effects in the spatial (dynamic) panel data models. In each type of spatial models, the spatial lag, spatial error, or spatial Durbin terms are used to model the endogenous\nspatial effects, contextual effects, and spatial error dependence. Common estimation and inference methods such as (quasi) maximum likelihood and GMM, and common tests such as LM tests, are introduced. Empirical illustrations are presented using Matlab or R software."

With these questions in mind, the course takes you through the classical models of trade that focus on cross-country differences as the source of gains from trade, the new trade theories that rely on imperfect competition and increasing returns to scale as the rationale for trade, and the recent models of multinational production with global sourcing of inputs.\n\nThe course continues with the welfare analysis of trade policy tools such as tariffs, quotas, and export subsidies. We compare the role of import quotas and tariffs under perfect competition and imperfect competition and study the role of strategic trade policy for international oligopolies. We study the political economy of trade protection as well as trade liberalization both at the multilateral level under the World Trade Organization (WTO) and at the bilateral/regional level. Examples of current debates in international trade that we analyze in-depth are the recent US-China trade war and the current global competition for market access in high-tech industries."

ESG considerations offer a multitude of benefits, both tangible and intangible including alignment with personal values, risk mitigation, potential for long-term outperformance, exposure to innovative companies, stakeholder engagement, regulatory compliance, and access to diverse investment opportunities. By integrating ESG factors into their investment decisions, investors not only seek financial returns but also contribute to positive social and environmental change. Sustainable investing has implications for all investment portfolios and incorporating ESG factors into investment decisions is becoming an increasingly important skill for anyone working in the investment industry. Investors are increasingly conscious about the impact of their investments on the world. ESG investing allows them to align their portfolios with their personal values by supporting companies that exhibit responsible practices in environmental stewardship, social justice, and ethical governance. Retail investors who incorporate ESG factors into their investment strategies may benefit from potentially higher returns and more resilient portfolios. As governments worldwide implement stricter regulations related to environmental protection, social responsibility, and corporate governance, companies that adhere to ESG principles may be better positioned to comply with evolving regulatory requirements. Investing in ESG-compliant companies can thus help investors navigate regulatory uncertainties and potential liabilities."

        "institution": "SMU",
        "description": "This course uses some of the most pressing global problems to motivate learning of the concepts and methods of game theory. Game theory is the branch of mathematics that deals with strategic interactions: situations where the benefits and costs of each agent or actor depends not just on her actions but also on the actions chosen by other agents. Many problems of global concern, like climate change, the use of artificial intelligence, pandemics, and great power conflicts, are characterized by the tension between self-interest and cooperation, miscommunication, and misalignment of incentives. Game theory is a powerful and incisive tool to analyse these issues because it has been used extensively to address collective-action challenges, which are at the heart of most game-theoretical applications in the social sciences; moreover, solutions to these challenges must account for information manipulation and unintended consequences, which are core game theory concepts.  Collective-action problems are situations where the objectives of the whole society or collective are best served if its members take a particular action or actions; however, as these actions are costly, and one can free-ride on others’ actions, individuals are disincentivized from cooperating. To solve these problems, game theory looks at how the strategic interaction among members can be improved to generate cooperation.  This course is designed for non-economics majors who want an accessible but also comprehensive and challenging introduction to the game-theoretic tools and principles essential for understanding the nature and possible solutions to collective-action problems without taking a standard game theory course. It is placed ideally within the Technology and Society basket, as it addresses social dilemmas and issues with conceptual or technological links to science."

What sets social enterprises and inclusive finance aside and makes it unique in the sustainability sector, is that unlike more commercial enterprises where the singular focus is on profit, these alternate models focus on primarily generating greater societal good. To explore the key contributions of inclusive finance to sustainability in this course, we will look at various case studies, academic articles and book chapters (in particular, from the region, ASEAN and South Asia) to evaluate the confluence of social entrepreneurship and financial inclusion, often with the aid of financial technology (FinTech)."

Discovering/ affirming their strengths and potential areas for growth, they could then chart an action plan for growth and identify possible careers/calling and what they need to do to pursue their career of choice or passion. Students would also appreciate the differences in various personality types and how people differ and why they behave the way they do and how they can better communicate and work with others.\n\nCareer Planning (FTW102)\nThe objective is to help students discover their underlying values, interests and skills and how they leverage on their strengths to pursue majors and careers they would excel in. The outcome is for students to formulate a career action planner where they identify their motivators, skills they enjoy using, values they believe in strongly and ultimately derive career goals and potential career path."

Students enrolled in the FTW200 will undertake the FTW200 series under the same instructor for five recurring weeks from Week 3 to Week 7 of the school term. Each component is a three-hour session.\n\nFTW201 Job Search Strategies\nJob search strategies will help students who have a general idea of their preferences or bias for certain type of job functions to explore deeper into the career of choice. Students have to perform due diligence and research the industry/job functions they are interested in and what the careers, occupation or their dream job entail and relate it back to their self-assessment and career plan. They need to conduct sufficient research into the companies of choice and how they could “navigate their way” into these companies and job functions. They also need to consider closing skills gaps, if any, and the career path and advancement. \n\nThis workshop introduces to students effective job search strategies, informational interviews, how to get insider’s information on industry and job function requirements.\n\nThe outcome is for students to make a more informed decision on their choice career and options available.\n\n\nFTW202 Resume and Cover Letter Writing \nThis workshop will equip students with the skills to write an effective Cover Letter and resume that will help them secure an internship – this is just the basic workshop as most 2nd years will not have sufficient internship or work experience to help them enhance their employability. Students will be exposed to different formats and the effective uses under various circumstances. They will be taught how to create a CV and the sections which are normally included in a CV and the contents to be featured under each section. Advanced CV writing will be taught as an elective in the 3rd or 4th year for those who want help and guidance to strengthen their CVs and start their job applications. \n\nThis workshop will focus on how to build a good resume as well as how to craft a resume and cover letter befitting to the industry and internship/job they are applying for. \n\n\nFTW203 Social Etiquette and Groom for Success\nThis workshop will deliver to students the knowledge of good personal hygiene and effective grooming and how to conduct themselves in professional and social setting. This workshop should spark their interest to discover themselves and how best to project a confident and professional image as coverage is wide and may not offer sufficient depth. Students are encouraged to do more research on their own or attend workshops which will give them the depth they desire. \n\n\nFTW204 Personal Branding and Networking Skills\nSMU has built a credible brand among the employers however, its brand attributes must also be reflected in its students. There are certain attributes that have attracted employers to SMU students, such as being articulate, innovative, intellectual curiosity, courage to challenge the status quo, adventuresome, skilful and resourceful. The emphasis should be for students to build a believable and consistent long-lasting personal brand with focus on core values for the workplace and in society, not just being well-groomed. \n\nNetworking skills are critical for students to succeed. To be effective networkers, they need to understand the acceptable decorum and etiquette for establishing business relationships and friendships; and the “how-tos” of maintaining contacts and building long-term relationships at work and play. \n\nThrough this workshop students can be more aware of developing and maintaining a consistent personal brand both in the online and offline world and become more comfortable in having conversations with other peers and professionals in both a social and work-based setting.\n\nFTW205 Interviewing Skills\nInterviews can be at times daunting and can be very stressful especially if the candidate walks into an interview without adequate preparation. Students can use the interview session to their advantage to impress the interviewers and present themselves as good potential hires. The interview session is not only to secure an internship or job but also a two way communication to explore and discover whether there is a good fit between the candidate, the job and the organizational and candidate’s expectations. \n\nThe objective of this workshop is to help students understand the objectives of the interviews, the different types of interviews and equip and practice good interviewing and listening skills in preparation for the internship/job applications."

Many of the questions evaluate the effects of public policy on competition and consumer welfare.\n\nIn empirical Industrial Organization, such questions are addressed by focusing on one industry and usage of appropriate data as well as econometric tools. This course introduces the main models and tools. Empirical methods include reduced form methods with a focus on establishing causal effects, as well as empirical methods that build on theoretical assumption. We work hands-on with estimating demand functions and modeling competition. Further, we evaluate counterfactuals. Note that the course involves econometrics and coding.\n\nNote that empirical tools of Industrial Organization are in high demand in the private and academic sector. Market regulators, antitrust- and marketing-consultancies, as well as competition authorities, are using econometric methods frequently.

Spatial data are commonly used in regional science and urban economics (related to property prices, crime, household income, etc.), epidemiology and public health (such as disease clusters, etc.), environmental science (climate change, air pollution, ozone density, etc.), ecology, biology, geology, social interactions and network effects, and other disciplines.\n\nWe will start the course by looking at practical aspects of organising and visualising spatial data. We will also discuss how to use a coordinate reference system to give spatial awareness to a dataset and make meaningful maps – the main visual aid for spatial data. Then we will consider the statistical and econometric aspects behind spatial data analysis with a special focus on how to re-align classical statistical and econometric techniques towards spatial data for the three broad types of spatial data: (i) point patterns, (ii) areal data and (iii) geostatistical data.\n\nExploratory spatial data analysis methods, including various plots and tests for spatial autocorrelation, are discussed. Diagnostic tests for complete spatial randomness against spatial clustering or dispersion is an important step in the initial stages of exploratory spatial data analysis. Point pattern analysis and different methods used to measure the degree of spatial autocorrelation will also be discussed. Spatial econometric models and estimation will be discussed in terms of areal data. Spatial econometric models and methods are effective in modelling spatial dependence and thus useful in predicting attributes that are affected/related to its’ neighbours. We will focus on the main spatial regression models (spatial lag, spatial error, and spatial Durbin) with and without heteroskedasticity. The usual estimation techniques, quasi-maximum likelihood and GMM methods are discussed for model estimation and inferences. The course will end by discussing main methods of interpolation techniques used in spatial data analysis."

        "description": "Most people spend much of their time working. But not everyone is miserable and unhappy like the quote above claims. What some do as work (in exchange for money), others would gladly do for free. Work is something that most people engage in for economic gain, but the social, psychological, and even political impact is less often examined. Conversely, leisure is often seen as the opposite of work. But some studies indicate that people might actually feel more engaged with work than leisure activities (Csikszentmihalyi, 2008). In this course we explore what work means to people, what leisure provides that work does not, and how individuals go about finding a balance between work and non-work in their lives.\n\nBroadly, the objective of this course is to provide students an opportunity to examine and reflect on different perspectives of work and non-work, and to start them on a journey to determine for themselves what work and non-work could be like in their own lives. Specifically, through class discussions and project work, I hope to be able to provide students a broad perspective on what constitutes work and non-work. This sets the stage for them to apply these perspectives to their own lives, and to gain insights for themselves regarding a possible balance between work and non-work, both in the present and the future."

Despite its beginnings as an improbable nation, Singapore's economic success has been dependent on political stability, of which the absence of overt ethnic conflict is fundamental. Yet, stable and meaningful ethnic relations cannot be left to chance. Indeed, a very deliberate and conscious effort, requiring a mixture of laws, institutions, mechanisms and political leadership and will, is needed to maintain ethnic relations in Singapore.\n\nThis course seeks to understand and to critically examine the legal framework and policies for the management of ethnic relations in Singapore. Laws alone are manifestly inadequate in maintaining peace on hot-button issues of race, language, and religion.\n\nThe course will also examine the political framework in place that complements the legal and policy infrastructure. Comparative studies will be done, where applicable, to articulate the key themes and issues."

        "title": "Asian Organised Crime: A Multidisciplinary Perspective",
        "institution": "SMU",
        "description": "Organised crime is a multi-factorial social problem. The study of organised crime in Asia has stimulated empirical investigations into a diversity of phenomena including the racialisation of criminals, supply chain organisation of illegal goods and services, corruption of legitimate actors and institutions, white collar criminality, and issues related to legislative frameworks and law enforcment efforts. Although the core subject is crime, efforts to understand, control, and eradicate organised crime in Asia has never been a uniquely criminological or even uniquely sociological endeavor. Instead of a monopoly by any single discipline, research into the field of organised crime in Asia has attracted scholars with diverse academic backgrounds including, psychology, economics, history, law and political science.\n\nThis course systematically charts and analyses the multidisciplinary dimensions of the study of organised crime in Asia, by drawing on scientific research done in the field of psychology, sociology, economics, political science, criminology, and cultural studies. Drawing on case study analysis of organised crime in Asia, metaphorical and substantive references to its interdisciplinary dimension will be highlighted on five levels of observation: the individual “organised criminal”, the activities these individuals are involved in, the associational patterns through which they are connected, the power structures that subordinate these individuals and collectives to common or particular interests, and the relations between these individuals, structures and activities on the one hand, and the legal spheres of society on the other. Subsequently, the course will highlight the advantages and critique the limitations of a multidisciplinary analysis of organised crime in Asia. In general, the study of organised crime has profited from an multidisciplinary approach. In these cases, concepts and theories have been adopted either on the assumption that organised crime is a facet of a larger phenomenon under investigation in other disciplines, or on the assumption that sufficient similarities exist between organised crime and the objects of study of other disciplines in order to permit the drawing of analogies. However, it is equally important to address the caveat that unless the borrowing of eclectic oncepts and theories from a variety of academic disciplines is strategically done to build up a cumulative body of knowledge, efforts to conceptualise, theorise, and police the complex phenomenon of organised crime in Asia will be compromised rather than facilitated."

It is concerned with the local, regional and global influences that have shaped the evolving meanings of cosmopolitanism for Singapore and its inhabitants. In particular, the course explores how these evolving meanings of cosmopolitanism emerge from negotiations and contests between Singapore’s leaders and peoples. Seminal events such as the founding of modern Singapore by agents of the British Empire, the Japanese occupation of Singapore during World War II, and the nationalist strivings of Singaporeans in the Cold War period, will feature prominently, as will debates over their significance and contribution to Singapore’s identity as a cosmopolitan city."

Many populations and governments feel they are unable to cope with the size of this playing field. People feel insecure and governments respond with populist inward-looking nationalism. However, we are individuals in societies. We cannot get away from living with people whose cultures and values we do not understand. Even if we bury our heads in the sand, the globalized world will not go away, for it is a fact of modern times. All of us will have to deal with people from diverse cultures in order to work and live successfully today.\n\nThis course gives insight into the thinking of communities other than our own. Religion is a primal response of man. Religion moves people beyond the rational to the transcendental and engenders such strong feelings people will go to war, and are willing to die for their faiths. Asia is the frontier of future economic development. It is crucial to know Asian society and culture for encounters with Asia can only increase."

        "description": "Nations have long sought to evoke loyalty and personal attachment, while in turn providing those living within it with a collective experience and common destiny. The potent force of the nation as a cognitive idea is at the heart of this course, which conceives of the making of a nation as an ongoing work in progress in which everyone has a stake. The central question that we will investigate concerns the reciprocal influences between the nation, its institutional manifestations and ‘the people’. How do ‘the people’ shape institutions and fashion a nation on a daily basis and vice versa?\nTo explore these relationships, the course is structured around three themes: prerequisites, process and practice. The first theme provides the general conceptual framework through a series of brief discussions of what a nation is, how it relates to a state and to a ‘people’. The second theme is devoted to what is often seen as the quintessential nation-building moment: the formal drafting of a constitution. We will consider the choice of language in that text to harness the people’s fidelity to the budding nation as well as the respective roles played by the elites and ordinary citizens during the constitution-process. For the third theme, we will probe the lived reality of how the nation constitutes itself every day through its people, from the elites who claim to speak on behalf of the nation in formal rule-making to the personification of the nation in image, song and icon to the architectural design of state institutions and public spaces and the wearing of folk costumes or traditional outfits that seek to give expression to the identity of the nation.\nOur explorations will feature the experiences of a diverse range of nations located within and outside Asia. These will provide the backdrop against which the Singapore story will be considered, thereby allowing students to interrogate the familiar domestic narrative of nation-building from a comparative angle. The approach taken will be practically grounded and interdisciplinary, drawing on insights from law, political theory, history, linguistics, architecture and the arts. To do so effectively, the course will be team-taught by two instructors with complementary disciplinary backgrounds."

This third age of human existence is characterised by retirement from full-time work and a new way of spending time (Carr & Komp, 2011). Through class discussions and group projects, students will dive deeper into disciplines like gerontology, social sciences (intergenerational; social connectedness), public policy (successful ageing), economics (retirement) and technological developments in the ageing space. Students will explore case studies and challenges of a rapidly ageing society in Singapore and around the world such as Japan, China, USA, Australia, Netherlands etc."

        "institution": "SMU",
        "description": "Humans have been making war and peace throughout their recorded history. We can be fairly certain this was the case well before civilization emerged. Conflicts always seem to erupt over scarce resources, contentious values and ideas, fissures in relationships, fault-lines in societies, the list goes on. And, intertwined with these conflicts are efforts to end violence, to heal wounds and reconcile, to share resources, to create or re-establish a semblance of harmony between peoples. Most of all will perceive these human activities as binary opposites, as mutually exclusive, leading us to invest particular meanings in each to distinguish them further from each other. Indeed, thanks to influences from culture, media, from our communities, families and leaders, we typically perceive war and peace as suffering versus happiness, action not stillness, a zone of masculine combat versus one of safety for women and children, and much more. These ingrained perceptions shape our decisions, actions and relationships in fundamental ways, determining our behaviour and experiences in all spaces and times, whether we have construed them to be in the context of war, peace, and anything beyond or in-between. Since our views of war and peace are so fundamental to our life experience, this course asks us for a deeper engagement of our prior knowledge.\n\nThrough critical engagement with a variety of disciplines and empirical contexts, we will consider the intertwined phenomena of war and peace in theory and praxis. The course explores the value systems we attach to each, why, and with what consequences for ourselves and others? We investigate how our notions of war and peace contribute directly to the construction of our identity as well as ideas about belonging, power, justice, progress, and more. In so doing, we look into the ways people, their customs, laws and culture respond to their perceptions and experiences of war and peace; reflect on how they debate the purposes of war-making and peace-making; and discuss how they compete and cooperate for the spoils of both war and peace. Also, we will study how our knowledge of war and peace may continually change over time. By the end of the course, students will have an expansive understanding of how these two phenomena come together in ways that structure and define their everyday lives."

Next, we interrogate how Asian nationalists and creative practitioners sought to move beyond these Orientalist tropes by adapting Shakespeare’s plays to create bold, new intercultural performances. We then dive into a range of canonical Asian texts and their contemporary adaptations. We ask what these texts can tell us about the connected political, cultural and technological histories of Asia and Europe; probe how these texts play shape our perceptions of racial, religious, national and gender differences; and ponder the place Singapore writers have in world literature today."

        "description": "Hailed as “the greatest book on democracy ever written,” Tocqueville’s Democracy in America offers a window into much more than the United States visited by Alexis de Tocqueville in the 1830s. Indeed, Tocqueville believed he “saw in America” an image of the future everywhere, for he believed that equality of conditions from which democratic society grew was the world’s inevitable future.  Having reached its most developed form in the United States, equality of conditions modified and transformed all aspects of life, from politics to social relations, to personal relations, to intellectual life, to individual character and values. Given this radical transformation of the world, Tocqueville believed that “A new political science is needed for a world entirely new,” and Democracy in America articulates this new political science.  Tocqueville’s masterpiece, then, looks beyond its US context, for Tocqueville hoped to teach his readers what they could hope and fear from democracy, as well as how democratic society might be “educated” to avoid some of the dangers to which it is prone. \n\nThis course takes its inspiration from Tocqueville’s ambition, by approaching Democracy in America thematically and using Tocqueville’s study as a basis for broader inquiry into features of contemporary democratic society. Each week of the course will focus on a key theme in Democracy in America, and each week will pair that theme with current scholarship applying and extending elements of the Tocquevillian perspective to contemporary contexts. By the end of the course, students will have gained familiarity with key elements of the Tocquevillian analysis of democratic society as well as critical perspectives on how these themes have continued to play out in current scholarship and debates."

We interrogate what ‘selfhood’ means to a range of established and emerging Asian writers, asking how and why they construct gender and ethnic identities in their works, and what insights this provides into the Asian psyche. We begin by interrogating gender in Singapore, asking how dramatists and novelists envision life as a ‘woman’ or a ‘man’ here. We then circle outwards across Indonesia, India and Iran, tracing how letters, novels, films and graphic novels have been used to create and challenge gender norms from the colonial 19th century to the postcolonial 21st. Next, we look at ethnicity, debating its relative mutability, and querying the importance of physical markers of ‘racial’ difference relative to evolving national borders and spiritual and societal practices. We trace how Singaporean and Malaysian writers construct ethnicity in their prose fiction, before considering how authors further afield in East Asia (Japan and China) and West Asia (Turkey and Afghanistan) have re-interpreted communal identities over time. We conclude by considering the future of ethnic and gender identities in Asia. By the end of this literary odyssey, students will have gained a wide-ranging appreciation of how modern Asian writers envision gender and ethnicity, and contemplated the relevance of these fictive visions to their own sense of selfhood as young adults living in Asia."

Their history can be traced back to World War  I  when  the  US  army  experimented  with  unmanned  aerial  torpedoes.  Nowadays, drone technology belongs to the military arsenal of many nations.  Drones serve many purposes (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance etc.), and they can be deadly. In business and society, drones are utilised to capture images of people and/or buildings, to monitor agricultural conditions, to take pictures from (or of) hard to reach places, to assess the impact of climate change on rainforests, to film events, to deliver parcels, to survey real estate, to deliver help to heart attack victims in remote areas via a flying defibrillator or to fly life-saving kits to swimmers in emergency situations. In view of their increasing importance in terms of commercial value creation, R&D (it is estimated that about $6.4 billion is spent annually for R&D on drones), job creation, innovation (e.g. Internet of Things), new forms of warfare as well as legal/moral-ethical/regulatory concerns, it is imperative that students learn to critically appreciate the multiple and often conflicting implications and consequences of this technology for business and society. To achieve that, students will have to read widely and familiarize themselves with the various drone functionalities in order to critically assess drone technology and to articulate informed opinions about ‘the good’, ‘the bad’, and ‘the future’ of unmanned aerial vehicles. The course will be taught by a multi-disciplinary team of instructors from three different SMU schools (LKCSB, SIS and SOL)  plus exposure to drone entrepreneurs  and  first-hand,  team-based  experiences  in  piloting  mini drones  within  the SMU campus."

Despite this, several traditions point to the need for thinking through forms of wealth (and poverty) beyond the conventional lens of economics, and to consider the pursuit of wealth of time, happiness, peace, relationships, and other elements that enrich the human experience. It is little wonder that in our contemporary age, several scholars have pointed towards the reprioritisation of wealth accumulation towards one that places happiness, health and other non-monetary goals as the ideal. In this course, we will be exploring substantially several forms of wealth (beyond the conventional), and to consider carefully the causes and strategies to address the challenges related to wealth and poverty in our contemporary world.\n\nThrough critical engagement with a variety of disciplines and empirical contexts, we will consider the intertwined phenomena of wealth and poverty in theory and praxis. The course explores the value systems we attach to each, why, and with what consequences for ourselves and others. We investigate how our notions of wealth and poverty contribute directly to the construction of our identity as well as ideas about inequality, power, justice, progress, and more. In so doing, we look into the ways people, their customs, laws and culture respond to their perceptions and experiences of wealth and poverty; reflect on how they debate the purposes and outcomes of wealth and poverty; and discuss how they compete and cooperate for limited resources in our contemporary world. Also, we will study how our knowledge and conception of wealth and poverty may continually change over time. By the end of the course, students will have an expansive understanding of how these two phenomena come together in ways that structure and define their everyday lives."

This course will first equip students with skills to identify rules of international law through discussions about sources of international law, and the tools to interpret such norms. Importantly, given the nebulous nature of certain areas of international law, students will learn to craft arguments advocating for or against the existence of certain international rules. This course will also cover certain foundational areas of international law, such as that of jurisdiction (when a court/tribunal can hear a dispute) and state responsibility (when a state is responsible for an act or omission). Following which, this course will narrow in on specific substantive areas of international law, where students will be exposed to the rules and unique challenges in these fields.\n\nBy the end of this course, students should be able to effectively analyze public international law issues using legal tools, taking into account policy considerations, and with an understanding of how public international law is changing."

Film mirrors and co-produces our understanding of the world and our place in it. Through film, we encounter societies and cultures beyond our own; and the world sees images of who we are through\nfilmic representations of ourselves. In this course, we explore the ways in which film has served as a space for the production, contestation, and meditation of representations and images of Asia in the United States through the lens of Hollywood films.\nThis course is designed to provide an interdisciplinary and visual approach to understanding Asia's representations and images on/in Hollywood films. First, we will briefly explore America’s perceptions and ideas about Asia in the late 19th century and discuss various methods of reading films as texts. Second, we will\ncritically examine what Hollywood films reveal about America’s perceptions and ideas about Asia within the context of Asia’s entangled history with the United States from the late 19th century to 1990s - from the period of American imperial expansion, America’s orientalism, US occupation of Japan, the Cold War, and\nAmerica’s involvement in Vietnam. Next, we will explore the recent trajectories in Hollywood that shaped/reconfigured Asia’s filmic representation - the commodification of Asia in Hollywood, the impact of 9/11 on Hollywood’s image of Asia, and the shifting aspects of Asian identities (gender and race) in\ncontemporary Hollywood films. Finally, we will examine the rising influence of Asia (its film industries, states, and societies) in global/Hollywood filmmaking and discuss how these disruptions and changes will impact Asia, the United States, and the rest of the world."

Thus, it is important that lawyers advising business firms understand these rules so they may help the clients to structure their transactions to maximize their benefits and minimize the costs. \n\nThis course will help the students to study the legal rules of the WTO, which cover tariff measures, antidumping and safeguard measures, food safety regulations, as well as domestic regulatory requirements. Using real WTO cases decided by the WTO tribunals as examples, the students will be able to critically examine how these rules are made, what are the impacts on business firms, how to argue the best case for their clients, and how these rules could be improved in the future. Taught by a former WTO staff member who is among a handful of people in the world who has worked on WTO cases at both Panel and Appellate Body levels as an insider, the students will also gain valuable insight into the WTO dispute settlement process, which arguably is the most important international tribunal in the world today. \n\nThe knowledge and skills learnt in this course will be helpful for students to explore a wide range of career options, including private law firms, government agencies (MFA, MTI), multinational companies, and international organizations (WTO, World Bank)."

In Singapore, this will refer to an older adult between 65 and 80+ years old. The Third Age offers opportunities and possibilities for a life of purpose and significance.\nThis Capstone course challenges students to apply knowledge and skills in their discipline to tackle the psychological, sociological, economics, and management challenges of a rapidly ageing society. It is a unique learning opportunity that emphasize the application of academic knowledge accumulated in prior core courses to solving real world problems. The course develops in students an ability to identify problems and develop solutions by analytic review and abstract idea generation. To achieve this, the capstone will simulate the “real world” through the development/implementation of innovative solutions to real client projects. Students will have the opportunity to assist industry partners make a positive impact in their efforts to engage the third agers in Singapore.\nClassroom sessions and SMU-X project will lead students to dive deeper into disciplines like gerontology (in particular, life span development framework of Third Age), social sciences (intergenerational), organizational behavior (diverse workplace), business management strategies (silver industry), economics, artificial intelligence & technology (in particular, elder-technology) related to the ageing population in Singapore.\nThe course will proceed by envisaging different aspects of ageing and society through published works on life in the Third Age including books, academic journal articles, case studies. Students will be working with our SMU-X industry partner, The Lien Foundation on their projects in the ageing space. Projects include the design of community space for older adults at the National Museum, and other initiatives to support Aging in Place at Yishun Community Hospital."

The course will investigate tensions and conflicts between nation-state based criminal justice and international norms, processes and procedures for regulating crime. It will assess the extent to which a distinct international criminal justice order is being established, the nature of its jurisprudence and values and its implications.\n\nFurther, it will offer students an understanding of criminal justice that is sensitive to debates about globalisation, policy transfer in comparative as well as international contexts. It will explore the nature of trans-national crimes and responses that seek the governance of global risk/security priorities, including financial crime and international terrorism. The course will analyse the role of the international criminal courts (and tribunals) and the different models of justice implied in competing international justice developments. In particular it will focus on debates between punitive and restorative justice principles from the perspective of legitimate victim interests. \n\nThis unit aims to provide students with knowledge of: \n\n1. the growing internationalisation of criminal justice through the establishment of international institutions for regulating transnational crime, \n2. the development of alternative justice processes across the globe, and\n3. international co-operation and supra-national developments in areas of criminal justice policies and practices."

As organizations in all three sectors experience a major push for enhancing social and environmental sustain-ability, often by means of cross-sector partnerships, a plethora of standards, metrics, and reporting requirements are emerging that purport to enable appropriate measurement and accountability.  But there is little agreement on what sustainability means, how to achieve it, or how to measure our behavior relative to sustainability standards: i.e., to know whether a given action is moving us in the right – or wrong – direction.  There is even less agreement on how to measure the contribution of cross-sector collaborations.\n\nPrevious MTSC courses have addressed the world’s major challenges and various approaches to understanding and managing them. In this module, we extend this to focus on how sustainability can be defined in actionable terms, looking at concepts of financial, social, and natural capital. We then investigate the leading experiments in measuring sustainability performance and partnership performance, building on our previous discussions of accountability.  \n\nThroughout the module, we focus on a set of questions that policymakers and practitioners are currently grappling with around the world.  \n\n• Can the Sustainable Development Goals and/or concepts such as natural and social capital and/or Planetary Boundaries provide effective markers against which to evaluate organiza-tional and system behavior and outcomes? \n\n• Do we have the data needed to know whether we are crossing planetary boundaries or achieving the SDGs and other global goals?\n\n• Do the various metrics and evaluation systems give us useful information? To whom is it useful?\n \n• Under what conditions do reporting requirements and investment indices shape organiza-tions’ behavior, and in what directions?\n \n• What do we know about the impact of cross-sector collaboration, as opposed to other approaches to large-scale problem-solving and systems change?"

The ‘data economy’ renders digitized information - promulgating at ever increasing speed – a valuable asset through the use of data analytics. It has also led to a fundamental shift in power and markets. The emergence of disruptive technological and business innovations is one prominent example of such a change. New economies are formed, such as from the use of artificial intelligence (AI), the development of ‘cognitive services’, the digitization of goods and the provision of storage/sharing and management services. Governments, including the Singapore public sector, are also aware of the importance of data to governance and to the future of the economy and are driving innovations and technology usage within that sector as well as in society generally through the Smart Nation initiative and Digital Economy drive. Substantial research and development are also encouraged in this field.\n\nThese fundamental shifts also lead to many problems and challenges related to different types of data and data sets. For Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) and the data economy generally, cybersecurity is a major concern. In relation to personal data and digital communications, there are various threats to different forms of privacy. Other current issues surrounding data are the ‘fake news’ phenomenon and the persistent threats to intellectual property. On the flipside, these developments have also led to new industries (and careers) such as in the areas of cybersecurity and data protection.\n\nThe objective of this course is to prepare students who are interested in data protection law and may have an interest in making a career in this nascent industry that is set to grow. Students will first be introduced to the data economy as a concept and to the real changes to the market and to society as well as the various forms and categorisations of data and the legal aspects to these data sets. The second part of the course will then focus on privacy law and its relationship with data protection (DP) law. In this context, comparative study will be made of privacy and DP regimes of significance (e.g. OECD, EU, APEC, etc.). Third, students will then focus their study on the Singapore Personal Data Protection Act (and other relevant laws) – in particular, the data protection and do not call provisions - by looking at its history, objective, scope/application and possible future developments e.g. Data Protection Ecosystem and PDPA Act Review. Comparative study of similar concepts and processes in other jurisdictions will also be assessed in the course of the study of the Singapore PDPA. The fundamental concepts and workings of the PDPA will be examined in depth. In the fourth part of the course, practitioners from the PDPC and the private sector will provide their perspectives on this process and a holistic and practical viewpoint to the study. \n\nAfter completing this course, students will be able to use what they have learnt to obtain professional certification such as from the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) and PDPC with a view to practice in this area as a privacy counsel, privacy professional, manager and/or technologist. This will prepare students for a career in this growing field, or at least provide them with the skills and knowledge when dealing with such issues as a TMT lawyer, legal counsel or even as a general legal practitioner that will possibly encounter these issues at work."

        "description": "In this day and age, it is no longer sufficient for managers and leaders in organizations to be simply transactional or simply transformational. They also need to be fair, just, ethical, moral and responsible. This course is designed to explore, inform, and stimulate thinking on issues related to behavioural ethics, responsibility and sustainability as encountered in the corporate world. To create this intellectual exchange, this course will focus on how individual and organizational behaviour is shaped by context as well as by biases, why these factors make it difficult for managers to be responsible leaders, and what can be done about the influence of these factors.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that the goal of this course is not the ethical or moral transformation of students but to develop a set of tools and frameworks (where possible) that allow us to manage effectively in a world increasingly characterized by stakeholders with competing needs and responsibilities."

        "description": "In the Western world of the mid-19th century, change was everywhere. Industry boomed, and the pace of life increased, leading to relentless urbanisation and a boost in mobility and communications. Travelling and the notion of taking a holiday were growing in popularity and a ‘culture of things’ primed consumerism as an expression of social status. While the abolition of slavery had begun, nationalism exploded in a Europe where Imperialism brought large parts of Asia and Africa under colonial rule and introduced new interactions, dependencies, and exploitations.\n\nArtists strove to find new ways of encapsulating this complex world through their creations. With the advent of photography and film, and new building and artistic techniques, some of the most exciting changes in art history took place. This period gave us creative universes as diverse as Monet’s open-air impressions, Renoir’s zest for life, Toulouse Lautrec’s underground worlds, and Van Gogh’s anguish.\n\nThroughout the 20th century, new sets of media and art forms appeared, and the social structure of the art world consolidated. New construction materials were used, artistic techniques developed, and a multitude of isms (Cubism, Futurism, Expressionism, etc.) challenged previous conventions. Artists supported and even championed the advancement of social causes. They were often at the forefront of protest movements against wars and injustices and denouncing discrimination by race, gender and sexual orientation. Today, contemporary art simultaneously experiences greater accessibility and democratisation. At the same time, it also suffers an increasing level of commodification and continues to evolve as it finds new ways to innovate, inspire, and provoke its audiences.\n\nThis course examines crucial works of art from the nineteenth century to the contemporary. It provides students with a roadmap to reflect on them in an open-minded, critical and analytical way. It considers historical, economic and socio-political contexts, and focuses on the integration of art within the broader cultural environment. This course offers new perspectives into the shifting kaleidoscope of art, and by its conclusion, students will develop a profound understanding of artworks that might have previously seemed inaccessible."

The issues are selected based on their topicality, feedback from industry, importance to Singapore and ASEAN and a review of academic and business literature.\n\nStudents will be guided in an exploration and analysis of cross-border trade law issues relating to the intersection of commerce and technology. In the first part of the course, an explanation of the some key issues will be provided to help students understand the broader context of trade in the digital economy. Students will then be exposed to a number of issues which are confronting policy-makers and the private sector, so that they may conduct legal research and craft clear and cogent law and policy recommendations from their findings. Industry professionals will help to provide feedback and discuss students’ findings and recommendations. Industry contacts in this course are likely to be from the fields of finance, technology, commerce, policy/strategy and law.\n\nIn addition to interactive learning with the course instructor (Professor Locknie Hsu), students will also receive industry and policy insights from 1-3 industry experts (who may be from the commerce and finance, technology and/or policy-making sectors)."

So is the antitrust suit against Google, and previously against Microsoft, Intel and many other IP giants. To provide a systemic solution to this conflict is the goal of this module. It will start with a detailed discussion of the general theory of IP laws and try to establish common principles applicable to all areas of IP. It will then introduce the competition law regimes on cartel, abuse of dominance and unfair competition, before it embarks on to examine  compulsory license of IP, exhaustion of IP,  resale price maintenance agreement  on IP protected protects, and the issuance of warning letters, which encompass all IP laws. The module will further break down to analyze the relationship between competition law and the exercise of specific IP rights, such as patents, copyrights, trademarks, design rights, plant variety rights, and eventually also  trade secrets."

This is a journey into the unknown. Yet, a still, small voice deep within us compels us: Courage! Do not be afraid! Put out into the deepest oceans and brave the stormiest seas! Let down your nets for an awesome catch!\n\nThe adventure reaches its peak at the project showcase, where we witness the work of human hands come to fruition, leaving us inspired to reflect deeply and broadly about how we, as global citizens, can harness the power of the Internet of Things as a potent force in the service of humanity.\n\nSounds lit? Bring some bubble tea, come and see: what’s the tea with IoT? #Slayyy"

Beginning with an exploration of what ownership of land means, this course will consider how land can be dealt with at common law and in equity, before taking a look at how some of these complexities have receded, given the adoption and universal application of the Torrens registration system in Singapore. In the middle part of this course, the question of ownership and transfer of moveable property at common law and in equity will be considered with particular attention to the difficulties posed by intangible moveable property in the form of intellectual property rights as well as other choices in action. The final part of the course examines the creation of security interests over immoveable and moveable property and the problems relating to determining the priorities of competing security interests. Comparisons may be drawn with alternative systems of property law, e.g. the scheme of security interests set out in the Uniform Commercial Code and the treatment of property generally in the American Restatement on Property."

This interdisciplinary course seeks to situate the Anthropocene in Asia by exploring its impact on the region's politics, markets, societies, and selves. We will primarily draw on the fields of environmental studies, anthropology, cultural studies, history, geography, and sociology to critically examine the multifaceted dimensions of the Anthropocene in the region.\n\nIn this course, we will explore contemporary debates around climate change, capitalism, biodiversity, and political and cultural ecology to understand the complex and interrelated challenges posed by these issues. In doing so, it will challenge us to rethink what it means to live, be, and thrive in the Anthropocene Asia. This course invites students to go beyond disciplinary paradigms and consider how emerging issues in the Anthropocene demand new ways of thinking, learning, and acting. Ultimately, we aim to foster a critical awareness of the Anthropocene and its impact on Asia, and to explore possibilities for sustainable and equitable futures."

        "description": "Disciplines within the social sciences have given analytical primacy to either the environment (sociology, for instance) or the agent (psychology, for instance) or the interaction (the rational choice school within economics, for instance). As such, the disciplinarily – limited study of social science provides an incomplete understanding of social action. Interdisciplinary work within the social sciences is an attempt to redress this flaw. Interdisciplinary social science then can be defined, equally pithily, as the integrated study of social action. This course is designed to introduce you to the nature and modes of, the steps involved in and the integrative frameworks for pursuing interdisciplinary social science.\n\nThe course is divided into three relatively self-contained units. The first unit (seminars 1-5) explores the nature and purpose of knowledge in the social sciences and, in this context, discusses the epistemic goals and the methodological individualism of the different disciplines within the social sciences. The second unit (seminars 6-8) presents several extant sites of interdisciplinary cooperation within the social sciences. The third unit (seminars 9-12) prepares you for engaging in interdisciplinary research; it introduces the different modes of interdisciplinary research and the tasks associated with such research, builds rudimentary familiarity with data-based reasoning, and concludes the course by providing practical advice on implementing an interdisciplinary research project."

The course introduces and explains the fundamental principles of Conflict of Laws. When problems arise in the relationship or transaction and the parties seek to resolve their disputes, the conflict of laws addresses four large issues: (1) when will a Singapore court exercise jurisdiction to adjudicate? (2) What can a Singapore court be asked to do to prevent a foreign court from adjudicating? (3) When will a Singapore court apply something other than the domestic law of Singapore to determine the claim? And (4) what effect will a foreign judgment have in Singapore? Given the cross-border nature of the issues, the position in other jurisdictions (for example, the applicable rules in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States) will also be considered for the purposes of comparison with Singapore law."

        "description": "International commercial arbitration has held itself out to be a fast, convenient and confidential means of binding dispute resolution. Since 1958, the wide spread recognition of arbitration awards by different countries, the promulgation of a model law of arbitration and a growing acceptance of a uniform set of best practices has increased the profile of arbitration. This is more so in Asia than anywhere else. In a region of varied court systems, arbitration offers certainty, due process, confidentiality and a quiet resolution. Or does it?\n\nAs arbitration is consensual, almost all arbitrations arise from a clause in an agreement. The agreement itself can address a myriad of dealings from joint ventures to distributorships to acquisitions. Lawyers in all commercial disciplines need to appreciate what their clients agree to when an arbitration clause is in their document. \n\nThe course is a study of the core principles applicable to international commercial arbitration, the main international rules and of the values adopted by Singapore in its efforts to become an international commercial arbitration centre."

The intention will be to take a complex case - maybe accountant or auditor negligence, maybe engineering disaster or pharmaceutical catastrophe - and look at the way it may evolve when the various interested parties (or their insurers) have divergent views about what litigation should take place, where it should take place, what may be done to stymie litigation in other places, and so forth: it will therefore examine law, procedure, and tactics. It will in part be done by reference to pleadings and skeleton arguments which will be drafted specially for the purpose. In the first year of its being offered, the course will be available only to final-year students who have completed the course on Commercial Conflict of Laws."

Islamic law has long been overlooked in traditional legal curricula yet it is increasingly important for practicing lawyers to have a basic familiarity with its commercial concepts, as a complement to common law and civil code systems. This subject is an introduction for law students to the primary sources of Islamic law (Sharī‘ah), Islamic commercial jurisprudence (fiqh al-mu‘āmalah), and jurisprudential methodology in Islam (usūl al-fiqh); legal interpretation and analysis through the methodology of ijtihād, and concepts of qiyās, ‘illah, istihsān, and maslāhah; Islamic law of contracts, including sales contracts (e.g. bai‘ al-salam, bai‘ al-inah, bai‘ al-istisnā‘) and partnerships used in commercial transactions (mudārabah and mushārakah); and the Islamic waqf."

In this context there will be an analysis of those legal principles which enable a bank (or its customer) to recover mistaken payments, as well as an examination of the bank's liability for the fraudulent activities of third parties. More generally, there will be a consideration of the bank’s responsibility as a fiduciary and its duty of confidentiality to its customer.\n\nThe second part of the course will then be devoted to the pivotal role of the bank as a finance provider. There will be a consideration of different types of loan, together with legal mechanisms that are available, or may be utilised, to secure their repayment  (for example, guarantees, set-offs, security over receivables and liens). Particular emphasis will be placed on problems of drafting. Attention will also be given to the bank's role in financing international trade through performance bonds and letters of credit."

Then we delve into key concerns about the creation and consumption of digital content. Some questions we will try to answer are:\n• Are we doing enough to protect Internet users from the growing range of online harms?\n• How do we hold anonymous threat actors accountable for objectionable online conduct?\n• Is there room for cancel culture in online discourse? Should we legislate against it?\n• How far should censorship extent now that so much content is so widely accessible from so many information streams?\n• Should we actively regulate generative AI at the risk of stifling innovation and growth?\n• Do individuals like you and I have a right to our own image in cyberspace?\n• What should legal and regulatory issues should content creators and online platforms be concerned about when doing business?\nThis course balances policy and practice. On a conceptual level, we will study regulatory challenges, approaches, regimes, and gaps. On the practical front, you will learn how to guide digital-media industry stakeholders (such as content creators, game developers, news sites etc) through common legal and regulatory issues.\nOver the course, you will learn about the governance challenges and social issues brought by digital media. More importantly, we will think critically about these complexities and emerging issues in a framework that focuses on keeping users safe while helping the industry thrive."

It will be taught from a practitioner’s real-world perspective and give students a glimpse into the interplay of law, sustainability and business in practice."

The fields of international trade and investment law are intertwined, and an understanding of the law, trade and investment barriers, practices, institutions and policies operating in these fields is essential to effective work in international law firms, multinational corporations and international legal work in government. The first part of this course examines the international trade landscape, the main institutional protagonist, namely the World Trade Organization, and its rules, while the second part examines the legal issues surrounding cross-border investment decisions and disputes, particularly those arising in ICSID arbitrations. The course will equip students with an understanding of the sources of law, its interpretative instruments, the relevant institutions and their rules and the ability to identify common trade and investment issues facing international businesses in order to work out appropriate legal advice and solutions."

More than that, constitutions express a state’s identity and provide the framework for all other laws and policies. This course will expose students to the challenges attendant on making constitutions work. At the same time, it will sensitise them to the extent to which the wider social, political and economic context and a country’s underlying culture affect the implementation of constitutional rules and values. Evergreens like the separation of powers, constitutional enforcement and dilemmas in ensuring equality and dignity will be explored through comparative study of experiences in a diverse range of jurisdictions. Instead of exploring models and constitutional solutions in the abstract, the course invites students to explore the practical impact and outcomes particular constitutional models and ideas produce in everyday life. To that end, we will amongst others compare the constitutional responses that different countries provide to contemporary challenges such as how to ensure effective public participation in governance without encouraging populism; the pervasiveness of migration for our understanding of citizenship and its entitlements; ensuring that everyone is treated equally while respecting individual autonomy and life choices; the role of technology in public life and the implications for privacy and free speech; and the role of a constitution in fostering economic development."

This course enables law students to step back to reflect upon what they have learnt in law school thus far by engaging philosophical concepts of law and justice through studying selected representative works of jurisprudence. Non-law students who are interested in philosophy or in thinking about law’s nature and its role in society will also have the opportunity to study these ideas as expounded by famous legal philosophers. \n\nWe will consider accounts of law offered by several legal positivists and modern natural law theorists, and challenges posed by alternative critical accounts. How do modern and critical accounts of law shape our thinking about the nature and purpose of law? How does adopting a particular account of law impact the practice of law? How can we, as lawyers or citizenry, harness law’s potential as a tool for transforming society?\n\nThrough this course, students will have a unique opportunity to engage their hearts and minds in relation to the concepts of law and justice. Students will also be encouraged to relate the theories studied to current contexts (e.g. laws that restrict personal liberty, unjust laws, how judges decide cases, and so on). The course's focus is on critique of ideas and not mere description of doctrine. The methods of assessment will be intentionally geared towards facilitating critical thought. This course encourages students to formulate their own theses about law and justice, and meaningfully understand their purpose in the legal process.\n\nThis course also offers law students a chance to study selected representative texts in jurisprudence in greater detail than in the law core module, Legal Theory & Philosophy. Students are not required to have done Legal Theory & Philosophy before taking this course."

The EU and ASEAN are among the world’s most advanced regional structures, representing distinct models of integration. Since the 1980s, the evolution of EU-ASEAN relations has offered valuable insights into the multifaceted concept of interregionalism in international law and relations. ASEAN became a priority in the EU’s Asia policy agenda following the Treaty of Lisbon, and the European Commission’s 2015 “Trade for All” strategy articulated an ASEAN approach based on individual agreements, culminating in a region-to-region framework. The recent conclusion of the EU’s trade and investment agreements with Singapore and Vietnam reinforces this incremental approach towards realising the EU-ASEAN free trade agreement.\n\nAmidst China’s changing status, the impasse in WTO negotiations, and the COVID-19 pandemic, EU-ASEAN legal frameworks and relations have gained prominence on the global stage. In 2020, the two blocs upgraded their “Dialogue Partnership” to a “Strategic Partnership,” which aimed at enhancing economic and security cooperation, sustainable connectivity, and development. In 2021, the EU’s Indo-Pacific strategy underscored its engagement with the ASEAN-led regional architecture, particularly in light of the economic and political impact of the CPTPP and RCEP.\n\nIn this SMU-X course, students will explore EU and ASEAN institutions and examine the EU’s new Indo-Pacific strategy from legal and political perspectives. The course will specifically evaluate EU-ASEAN economic agreements and focus on cutting-edge areas such as trade and investment liberalisation, AI and digital trade, and sustainable development. Students will gain practical experience by collaborating with legal and policy experts to tackle real-world challenges.\n\nPlease note: This course does not include an overseas trip and does not meet SMU’s global exposure requirement. However, students will visit EU and/or ASEAN institutions in Singapore and engage in projects with legal and policy experts specialising in EU-ASEAN law and relations. The course will also incorporate SMU’s blended learning approach, which may include some online sessions. The grade will be on a pass/fail basis."

They will cover specific areas such as development of case theory, opening statements, cross-examination techniques and closing submissions. This will give the students real insight into the actual workings of litigation practice in Singapore and an opportunity to interact with and be inspired by the very best litigators in town through the practice sessions. The practice sessions will be a series of 4 “learn-by-doing” workshops, where the students will be asked to perform various advocacy tasks using a case study in a simulated court room environment. The seminars will focus on the following areas: \n•\tDevelopment of case theory \n•\tPleadings \n•\tPreparing for trial \n•\tDrafting Opening Statements \n•\tDrafting Affidavits Examination-in-chief \n•\tLearning Cross-examination and Re-examination \n•\tDrafting Closing Submissions \n•\tEthics and Etiquette\nThis will give students a hands-on opportunity to practice trial techniques and strategies with the assistance of experienced and skilled trainers, who will offer constructive and practical suggestions in a supportive learning environment.

In those contexts, the substantive policies and principles of the law will be addressed – e.g. , the pari passu principle, the concept of set-off, and the avoidance of suspect transactions entered in the run-up to insolvency. In addition, the course will consider informal debt restructurings (work-outs), and also introduce the issues and developing law relating to cross-border insolvencies. As well as providing a theoretical grounding in corporate insolvency principles, it is expected that aspects of the course will involve the participation of specialist insolvency lawyers from private practice, with the aim of providing a practical perspective. \nAlthough the primary focus will be on corporate insolvency, comparison will be made with the procedures and rules applicable in the bankruptcy of individuals. It is likely that before or during the period of the course the Government will publish a draft Insolvency Bill combining and amending the rules applicable to both individual and corporate insolvency.

All big cities in both First and Third World countries as well as emerging markets such as New York, London, Tokyo, Paris, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, New Dehli, Jakarta etc. have to cope with high population density and serious challenges such as air pollution or traffic congestion. How do we pack more people into big cities and yet continue to achieve a high quality of life? How do we create and manage ‘good cities’ which are safe, spacious, green, connected, fair and resilient? How can cities create economic wealth while still fulfilling the CSR responsibilities of sustaining a “Green Planet”? What are the best practice designs and technical smart city solutions which could be leveraged to tackle these challenges and how can they be successfully commercialised? This course will provide answers to these questions with special emphasis on the managerial and commercial aspects of smart city concepts. \n\nThe key lies in creating and effectively managing innovative and sustainable, smart cities able to leverage on new technologies such as smart grids or sensor networks to create a place where people can live, play and work well. Starting from the stakeholder requirements of citizens and planners of innovative cities, the course will introduce students to urban design concepts as well as commercialization, management challenges and implementation issues of the smart city model. There will also be a focus on how good governance and enabling technologies such as sensor networks can facilitate the creation, management and sustainability of ‘good’ cities.\n \nWith the help of case studies and resource persons such as industry leaders, innovative city designers, tech experts and business development experts from local and int. companies such as ST Electronics, JTC, Jurong Consultants, Frost & Sullivan, IDA International, Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) etc., students will be familiarized with the opportunities and challenges of the ‘smart city business’ which represents a key element in the value creation and extraction strategy of the Singapore Government and related businesses."

Drones are unmanned, multi-purpose tools. Their history can be traced back to World War I when the US army experimented with unmanned aerial torpedos. Nowadays, drone technology belongs to the military arsenal of many nations. Drones serve many purposes (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance etc.), and they can be deadly. In business and society, drones are utilised to capture images of people and/or buildings, to monitor agricultural conditions, to take pictures from (or of) hard to reach places, to assess the impact of climate change on rainforests, to film events, to deliver parcels, to survey real estate, to deliver help to heart attack victims in remote areas via a flying defibrillator or to fly life-saving kits to swimmers in emergency situations. In view of their increasing importance in terms of commercial value creation, R&D (it is estimated that about $6.4 billion is spent annually for R&D on drones), job creation, innovation (e.g. Internet of Things), new forms of warfare as well as legal/moral-ethical/regulatory concerns, it is imperative that students learn to critically appreciate the multiple and often conflicting implications and consequences of this technology for business and society. To achieve that, students will have to read widely and familiarize themselves with the various functionalities of robotics, UAVs and digital innovations in order to critically assess these technologies and to articulate informed opinions about ‘the good’, ‘the bad’, and ‘the future’ of these novel technological developments. The course will be taught by a multi-disciplinary team of instructors plus exposure to tech entrepreneurs and digital (corporate) innovation champions."

The materials that will be analyzed in the course will be the BITs and the investment protection chapters in the FTAs concluded by Singapore, a few principal model BITs issued by countries such as the US, some typical foreign investment protection laws of some ASEAN countries and the decisional law of investment dispute tribunals such as the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)."

As A.I. technology is already surpassing human decision-making in certain instances, there is growing concern about ‘uncontrolled A.I.’ in business and society, incl. regulatory and ethical-legal challenges. Against this background, this new course aims to equip students with foundational, theoretical and practical knowledge about A.I. driven business applications in selected private and public sector organizations. Besides reconstructing the history of artificial intelligence from the 1960s to the current era (as well as a refresher about the basics of computer science algorithms such as audio and video compression algorithms), we will put emphasis on explaining the A.I. driven business models of several top international and local organizations. In order to appreciate the power of A.I. technology, we will take a closer look ‘under the A.I. hood’ to understand what makes machine learning, deep learning, neural networks and image analysis tick.

        "institution": "SMU",
        "description": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has bloomed this year, entering the lives of many students and the general public’s use. Historically, there have been different types of AI, but the type underlying the most popular and current AI – neural networks – has become greatly influential in recent years, and has actually been working in the background of many applications for several years already. This AI technology resembles human thinking at neural levels, but are not clear matches to how humans process knowledge. The are now adapted to process language and images, and underlie the most popular kinds of AI, such as ChatGPT and Midjourney. As such, we will focus on these types of AI.\n\nStudies of AIs’ impacts from just a few years ago are already outdated due to the rise of these new AIs. In part, this is because the current AI has shown itself to be capable of many feats. This has led to a surge of funding of AI startups, and the emerging industry could be expected to supercharge some firms, tasks, and types of work.\n\nIn order to understand the implications of this type of AI, we will investigate the differences in types of AI and the current technologies that have so attracted investors, firms, and users alike. We will delve into human intelligence and concepts of how intelligence, understanding and meaning are conceived to exist in humans, and to be created in AI.\n\nWe will focus on two implications of the new types of AI. (These will be grounded in the understandings of human intelligence and AI arrived at in the first part of the course). The first is the implications for how work tasks can change (based partly on your own experiments and introspections), and consequently, on the future of jobs and employment. Much of this will be based on the direct use of ChatGPT to assess its capabilities for various kinds of work.\n\nA second type of implication we will study from this grounded basis is that of how different kinds of AI firms and startups, and uses of AI, are emerging. Since much of the impact will come from the embedding of AI in the broader automation of work systems and firms, the broader context will be kept in mind. A business model approach will be used to study these forms of entrepreneurship and transformation.\n\nThe course does not employ mathematics or computational work, but AI applications are used and explored, but generally involves higher levels of reasoning, and multi-disciplinary approaches."

These theories are empirical, normative or critical in approach, or are a combination of all of these approaches. We will look at these theories and will consider how they might relate to familiar doctrines found in international law."

Five key regulatory challenges are highlighted, namely: (i) adopting a prudent and suitably precautionary approach to risk; (ii) setting standards that are legitimate (as well as employing legitimate regulatory means); (iii) rendering regulation effective (or fit for purpose); (iv) maintaining a sustainable connection between law and technology; and (v) acting in a way that respects cosmopolitan calls for both compliance with universal standards and tolerance of local cultural diversity. These are the challenges of regulatory prudence, regulatory legitimacy, regulatory effectiveness, regulatory connection, and regulatory cosmopolitanism."

These three challenges (positioned at the interface of both current and future issues) are not only globally relevant but also have significant local implications for Singapore.\n\nEmbedded in the experiential SMU-X initiative, the Transformative Leadership course provides students with a unique learning opportunity to develop and implement (socially) innovative solutions to make a positive impact on business and society in close collaboration with reputable partners in business, nonprofits and government. Learners will be paired up with an external SMU-X partner to work on relevant innovative projects with real impact.\n\nThe successful completion of such transformative SMU-X projects requires learners diving deep(er) into various disciplines such as social sciences, business, political governance, public policy, demography, technology, etc. It is expected that the chosen practical challenges commissioned by SMU-X partners will ‘stretch’ students, forcing them to step out of their comfort zones and to explore the unknowns in order to make a ‘real’ difference ‘out there’ in both the social and business sectors.\n\nIn terms of effective leader development, in particular, transformative leadership, the SMU-X course design will support learners in expanding their individual capacity to be effective in leadership roles and processes. Emphasis will be put on proximal indicators of leader development such as self-views around self-concept, including leader self-awareness, leadership self-efficacy and leader. Through their SMU-X projects, students will appreciate the importance of leadership development so that they can articulate what it takes for teams and their leaders to create strong(er) alignment and high(er) levels of commitment. The latter requires interpersonal trust, care and concern as well as shared mind-sets regarding (transformative) goals and values such as the ‘real’ sharing propelled by collaborative leadership approaches."

Issues covered will include: contracts, torts, labour law (mostly collective bargaining agreements), (limited) copyright and trademark issues specific to film/music/publishing, Lanham Act (unregistered trademark law), idea submission cases, and both statutory and common law causes of action particular to these industries, including a brief review of accounting issues in the film industry.  \nMixed into the case studies will be an introduction to a number of common contracts in the film industry—writers, directors, actors, producers, distributors etc.---and students will learn the main deal points and many negotiating strategies surrounding these contracts."

This affects our attention, emotions, cognitions, well-being, functioning, and performance. It challenges our ability to flourish, to both feel well and do well. In this course, we explore the science and practice of mindfulness as a way of flourishing at work and in life. Mindfulness-based practices are rooted in Eastern contemplative traditions but have been adapted to a secular, modern context. A large amount of research has accumulated, showing that such mindfulness-based practices confer numerous benefits both for well-being and functioning, including at the workplace.\n\n“Mindfulness at work” has two meanings in this course: First, we will focus on mindfulness in the context of work and organizations. Second, we will incorporate mindfulness practices such as mindfulness meditations into the course itself. Thus, in this course, we will examine both the science as well as the practice of mindfulness. For the science aspect, we will read and discuss scientific research studies on mindfulness related to each of the course topics. For the practice aspect, we will engage in mindfulness practices based on established and carefully designed secular mindfulness trainings. The practice aspect is integral to this course and students will be required to commit about 20-45 minutes daily to these practices. Evidence suggests that the practices can help individuals feel and function better and are a good investment of the students’ time."

The course therefore explains how these problems ought not be addressed through siloed approaches but instead demand interdisciplinary approaches to fully unpack and understand the complexity of the various dynamics at play within these challenging areas. For the first half of the semester, we will be exploring SDG 10 ‘Reducing Inequalities’, by engaging academics from different backgrounds who will identify how various disciplines approach and respond to this goal. For the second half of the semester, we will be responding to this work by applying its lessons to your own BIS Capstone/Senior Thesis with explicit attention to the challenges to conducting interdisciplinary research. The ultimate aim is for you to have a cohesive approach and beginning to your BIS path and set your framework early on in your integrative journey."

However, what are these positives and negatives, how do they combine and inter-relate, and why and how do they matter? The psychological study of subjective well-being attempts to address these questions using an evidence-based approach grounded in the scientific method and the empirical research on the constructs, causes, correlates, and consequences of SWB. The goal of this course is to introduce students to the scientific literature and psychological study of SWB. Although the primary focus is on SWB at the individual level due to the inherently subjective nature of the construct, we will also discuss issues and implications in the contexts and levels beyond the individual such as the team, organizational or national levels."

Many Singapore and international law firms have arbitration teams in Singapore—many more will form these teams in the near future to take advantage of the steady upward trend in the volume of casework in the region. Arbitration work is by definition international, peripatetic, multi-lingual, multi-cultural and spans all industries that make up international business. No two cases are the same. It is a challenging field that attracts talented lawyers from all over the world. It is an exciting time to be an arbitration lawyer in Singapore.\n\nThis course provides a rigorous “hands-on” practical introduction to International Arbitration with a focus on experiential learning.

We will approach these material elements of the urban fabric as dynamic rather than static, examining the diverse ways in which people imagine, make, inhabit, use, contest, and remember particular sites and spaces. We will also explore how the built environment mediates a range of pressing challenges faced by contemporary Asian cities, including global climate change, rising inequality, rapid expansion, and political exclusion."

Constructing Singapore’s history remains a struggle against competing notions of the state as a tool of British colonialism, an adjunct of Malaysia before its untimely expulsion, immigrants’ lay-over and Lee Kuan Yew’s political success. Since independence, Singapore’s leaders lament its lacking natural resources to justify their “pragmatic” management of the everyday lives of Singaporeans, including speech, educational environment, sexuality, religious expressions, ethnic identity and political culture, at the expense of citizens’ rights. Populated dominantly by ethnic Chinese with Malays and Indians as minorities, yet geographically surrounded by Muslim-majority nations have made the ruling PAP reluctant to observe multiracialism in governance policies which compromises the nation-building project. Presently, forces of globalisation threaten the state’s monopoly over political space and ideologies. This module targets students interested in developing a critical appreciation of the socio-economic and political contexts that structure Singaporeans’ daily lives. It highlights critical historical circumstances that shape Singapore’s post-independent governance policies, political discourses and contemporary development as a nation-state. It sharpens students’ sociological imagination as they deconstruct political ideologies to grasp alternative interpretations of the development of Singapore society and make sense of contemporary issues of importance in Singapore and to Singaporeans."

Such situations turn hazards into disasters.

To set the scene there will be a consideration of freedom of speech and expression and, in particular, press freedom as a constitutional concept; and how these should be balanced against countervailing public interests such as protection of privacy, reputation, and confidence in the administration of justice. This will be followed by an examination of the following topics: how the print and broadcast media (including the Internet) are regulated; defamation law as it relates to the media, particularly the public figure and responsible journalism defences; criminal offences such as contempt of court, criminal defamation and sedition that restrict the publication of certain types of content; conflict of laws and criminal extraterritoriality issues arising when material from abroad can be accessed in Singapore; and the efficacy of self-regulation in the media industry. A number of these issues will be illuminated by examining key court judgments such as Review Publishing v Lee Hsien Loong [2010] 1 SLR 52, CA, and Shadrake v Attorney-General [2011] 3 SLR 778, CA; and legislation such as the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act (Cap 206, 2002 Rev Ed) and the Broadcasting (Class Licence) (Amendment) Notification 2013 (S 330/2013).

        "institution": "SMU",
        "description": "For the past ten years at least, the idea of the smart city has become a guiding logic for urban development throughout the world. Urban environments are increasingly sensed environments, which has led to the creation of vast volumes of data, the leveraging of which can create value for an array of public, private and people stakeholders. As a heuristic that captures these processes of sensing, creating and leveraging data, smart cities are meant to be more responsive, adaptive, predictive, and potentially liveable and sustainable than their “non-smart” antecedents. However, in the pursuit of “smartness”, so too must critical questions be asked about the neoliberalisation of the urban commons, the importance of civic participation, and the potential for smartness to create new forms of division, inequality and inequity in our cities.\n\nWith this in mind, this course foregrounds the uniquenesses of Asian cities to better understand the uneven global geography of the smart city paradigm. In doing so, it considers what defines a “smart” city, and how Asian cities might be considered as theoretically distinct from their non-Asian counterparts. It also explores the role of the Asian developmental state, of centralised planning and policy regimes, and of urban informality on the translation of smart city policy visions to on-the-ground urban realities. Through these considerations and explorations, the course seeks to appreciate different ways of thinking about Asian smart cities, how they might be different from their non-Asian counterparts, and how they might reveal new, and perhaps more aspirational visions of urban futurity in Asia and beyond."

By looking at the colonial era in these two countries the course enables insight into how political and economic development have been tied to uneven power structures, many of which still endure. The course looks at urban development as well as the process of land-use change in the countries more broadly, connecting changes such as population growth to broader environmental and socio-political and economic issues. It also explores the origins of environmental thought, as a direct product of the stark and rapid changes wrought by ‘progress’. As the eminent environmental historian Richard Grove once said, colonialism is a lens through which broad and long-term patterns of environmental changes (and their catalysts) can be analysed in microcosm."

        "description": "For many lawyers and legal advisers working in Asia, an increasingly important aspect of their work is their more substantial involvement in cross-border transactions with PRC components.  Most of these transactions are large-scale commercial transactions, and this Course will focus on those kinds of transactions.\n\nEven amongst commercial transactions, there are many types and the work that an adviser needs to work on is varied and, in many cases, complex, difficult and growingly challenging (given the differences between two jurisdictions).  This Course focuses on a few of those transactions such as joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions, banking finance: it is not possible in the time available to deal with all of them.\n\nThe approach in this Course is to follow a fairly straightforward transaction for a single client through from beginning to end.  It will start with the client, who has never done business in the Mainland China before, coming to the legal adviser seeking legal advice and assistance.  Then the client will decide on the type of business it wants to use, taking into account the many factors the client needs to consider.  The client will then set up the business in the Mainland China.  After that it will buy some materials and sell some products.  It will also need to raise some money for the business. Later on, it may expand its China business by merging or acquiring a target company (or its assets). Unfortunately, a dispute will arise and the client will seek advice on how to deal with it.\n\nThe aim of this Course is to enable you to be acquainted with the legal issues in regard to foreign investment projects in China and associated commercial legal transactions. This Course will appeal not only to LLB/JD students but also future entrepreneurs seeking to do business in China."

Students will learn by studying SMU IS student project case studies. The case studies shows what worked and why they failed. They will emphasize the strength and limitations of IT solutions, team work and project management.\n\nA major part of this course involve doing a project with a real problem that the student proposes or selects from a list of partners. The project requires student to empathize with the target user, share the discovered insights, brainstorm ideas by exploring IT solutions, scope the project, present the storyboard, build a prototype, test with users and repeat the iteration over again. Experiencing these Design Thinking activities allows the student to incorporate an innovative mindset into their daily lives when solving problems.\n\nLearning by doing the interactive activities such as emphathing with users, we hope you will discover what people really care about and how they use IT solutions. We find this method of learning helps retain deeper learning than being presented with theories. Working on a real project in a team is more interesting and helps us acquire inter disciplinary skills that include managing projects, team work, understanding diversity and incremental creativity.\n\nAt the end of the semester, you will present your final design work in a session to a panel of peer judges."

        "description": "Commercial transactions now frequently take place across borders. The growth of international trade has given rise to a corresponding increase in the number of transnational commercial disputes. Commercial parties desire a swift, practical and cost-effective resolution of such disputes. National legal systems were designed primarily to manage intra-jurisdictional disputes and were perhaps not particularly well-equipped to deal with cross-border disputes. \n\nInternational arbitration has provided a big part of the answer and serves as a primary if not default means of resolving transnational commercial disputes today. More recently, the courts in a number of jurisdictions have also innovated to fit into the changed dispute resolution landscape. They have established specialized international commercial courts such as in Dubai, and most recently, in Singapore as viable alternatives to international arbitration, depending on the parties’ particular needs. \n\nAny student with interest in pursuing a career in international commercial dispute resolution needs to have a good grasp of the process of the creation of commercial law and how they are enforced through various dispute resolution mechanisms.  The objectives of the course are to equip students with a working knowledge of the Singapore International Commercial Court, as well as prepare students to practise in the field of international arbitration. Course content is roughly divided equally between international commercial dispute resolution and international arbitration. \n\nThe part of the course on international arbitration will be focused on practical aspects of international arbitration procedure. It will be a “learn by doing” academy which may revolve around a case study as the vehicle through which students will be exposed to some of the more significant stages of the dispute resolution process. \n\nSome knowledge of the basics of international commercial arbitration and commercial conflict of laws would be complementary though not necessary."

Courts have increasingly had to contend with these cross-border issues. As the activities of corporations often transcend national frontiers and the consequences of such activities can be felt in a great number of States, there is increasing awareness that some form of supranational regulation of corporations is necessary in certain areas such as the protection of human rights and the environment and the fight against corruption. \n\nDuring the same period, business and human rights has emerged as a distinct field. The United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (2011), for example, define a corporate responsibility to respect human rights. In response to growing pressure to address human rights issues, some transnational companies have begun to conduct human rights due diligence and integrate human rights considerations in corporate policies and practices. \n\nDrawing on international standards, industry case studies, legal proceedings, the work of international organizations, and a growing academic literature, course explores the theoretical difficulties in securing corporate responsibility for human rights abuses within the framework of transnational law; as well as the practical aspects of enforcing such responsibility in international and national courts and tribunals, with a particular focus on the Southeast Asian region. "

We will adopt a topical approach, where students explore different areas of the law and psychology’s relevance to them each week. A sampling of the issues we will cover include:\n\n•  mental disorders and their implications for offending behaviour and criminal procedure\n•  human memory and its effects on eyewitness and courtroom testimony;\n•  custody evaluations and psychological assessment in family law proceedings;\n•  behaviourial theories underlying principles in tort and evidence law; and\n•  how lawyering skills such as negotiation, persuasion and advocacy can be enhanced and informed by psychological research.\n\nThis course seeks to develop better practitioners for the future by giving fledgling lawyers the psychological lens they may require to make sense of practical issues that commonly arise in practice. Students will also grow to appreciate that the law does not operate in a silo, but in the context of other disciplines that contribute towards its practice, policy, institutions and mechanics."

We shall also explore how public international law deals with the issue of nuclear weapons, taking the atomic attacks of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 as our lead examples, as well as the choice of targets (i.e. the increased destruction of hospitals in the Syrian conflict, as shown in The New Barbarianism). There shall be a strong reliance on actual examples of warfare—from Vietnam, to the destruction of cultural property such as the Buddas of Bamiyan of Afghanistan, through the justice for ‘comfort women’ or sexual slaves who suffered at the hands of Japan at the end of the Second World War to the belligerent occupation of Iraq—to explain the basic tenets of and strengths of the law but also the unique problems by trying to introduce order into chaos."

Image perception is the task of getting computers to see in a human like manner. To achieve this, researchers have pooled techniques and results from a large variety of different fields.\nThis course introduces the mathematical tools and concepts underlying image perception. These include deep learning, linear algebra, statistics and multi-view geometry. The goal is to get students comfortable with utilizing and interpreting the results of state-of-art machine learning techniques. At the end of the course, students should be aware of what can be achieved by current visual perception techniques, how to achieve it and what the limitations of these techniques are.\n\nStudents are expected to have a good mathematical foundation and programing skills. Foundational Mathematical Courses (i.e., CS103 or CS105) will be an advantage but are not insisted on. The primary programing language of the course is python."

It will be shown that, even though most insolvency jurisdictions seek to solve similar economic problems, the way to do so differs across jurisdictions. After becoming familiar with the insolvency regime existing in some relevant jurisdictions, we will analyse which factors and insolvency provisions may help create an optimal insolvency regime. In order to do so, we will take into account the economic problems that insolvency law seeks to solve, the particular features of a country, and the impact that the solutions provided by insolvency legislators may have on entrepreneurship, innovation, and access to finance. It will be shown that insolvency law is a very powerful tool to promote growth in a country. For this reason, linked to the fact that many jurisdictions want to become global centres for corporate restructurings, several countries around the globe are amending their insolvency laws. Among other proposals, we will analyse those existing in the United States and Europe, and which steps are being taken by Singapore to become a global leader for corporate reorganizations. The course will conclude with an analysis of the primary problems, challenges and solutions to deal with cross-border insolvency. For that purpose, we will analyse the features of the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross Border Insolvency, as well as some regional initiatives - such as the European Insolvency Regulation- to deal with those problems arising in a situation of insolvency in which there is an international component."

ABMS systems are particularly powerful if we want to describe a system populated by many independent and heterogeneous decision makers (who can be collaborators or competitors). ABMS systems can also be used in performing policy evaluations and generating decision supports, as we can then computationally test how changes in parameters at different levels would affect various performance indicators.\n\nBesides covering theoretic foundations of ABMS, we focus heavily on hands-on learning as well. In particular, we will expose students to NetLogo, an intuitive yet powerful modeling language for building ABMS systems. We will be learning NetLogo by building several classical ABMS examples incrementally in class.\n\nObjectives\nUpon successful completion of this course, a student will be able to:\n• Understand what is an ABMS.\n• Evaluate the pros and cons of using an ABMS system in describing selected real-world phenomena.\n• Utilize ABMS systems in policy/strategy evaluations.\n• Appreciate the importance of considering uncertainty and opponent modeling when designing strategic, tactic, and operational policies.\n• Complete the full cycle of building an ABMS system using the NetLogo programming language:\n  o Design an ABMS system with a proper level of granularity and fidelity (defining agents and means of communications).\n  o Validate and calibrate the built ABMS. \n  o Interpret the outcome of the ABMS system."

While these AI techniques have demonstrated remarkable, occasionally superhuman, performance across numerous applications, there is a growing concern regarding their safety and security. It has been shown AI systems are subject to a range of attacks, ranging from adversarial attacks (i.e., perturbing an input slightly causes an AI to make completely wrong predictions), backdoor attacks (i.e., backdoors can be easily embedded in neural networks), and privacy-violating attacks such as membership inference attacks (i.e., an adversary may reliably infer whether a certain sample is used during training or not). In addition, AI systems can inherit or amplify biases present in their training data, potentially leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. Furthermore, many AI models, including GPT, are complex and not easily interpretable. It makes understanding how these models make decisions highly nontrivial, even though it is crucial for trust and accountability.\n\n\nThis course aims to present a systematic view on the range of AI safety problems that have been identified, analyse their root causes, and study potential approaches to mitigate the safety and security risks. In particular, we will focus on answering two key questions. First, given an AI system, how do we systematically evaluate its safety risk? Second, given an AI system that potentially has safety issues, how do we systematically mitigate the risks? This course will feature real-life AI safety issues on popular AI systems such as ImageNet, GPT and so on."

It is a unique course which allows law students to acquire a different perspective of legal work through personalised interaction with senior Judges, working on actual cases and experiencing legal practice in real-life settings.\n\n2. In the course of the Clerkship Programme, the Clerks will be required to assist Judges with legal research and case analysis in cases involving more complex legal issues. The Clerks will experience the realities of court proceedings from observing court hearings and interacting with the Judges. From the vantage point of the decision-maker, the Clerks will get to experience first-hand the adjudication process of receiving and weighing relevant facts and evidence, assessing the credibility of witnesses, and persuasion by opposing parties.\n\n3. The Clerkship Programme will allow Clerks to practise and consolidate legal skills already acquired under the core curriculum through case research, writing and analysis. Through exposure to court litigation, the Clerks will be able to hone higher cognitive legal skills through critical analysis of facts, evidence, legal arguments and persuasion, as well as to gain a unique understanding of the critical processes in fact-finding and decision-making from a judicial perspective. Through interaction with Judges and other legal professionals, such as lawyers and court staff, the Clerk will learn higher level professional skills in communication and court craft, which are critical in their future careers as lawyers. The clerkship training will allow Clerks to learn the intricacies of various processes and rules in the context of judicial administration and engage in self-learning of substantive areas of law across disciplines.\n\n4. As the Clerkship Programme is intended to prepare the Clerks for life as a legal professional and takes place in a real world setting where court schedules are subject to change and other exigencies, the learning experience can be expected to be a rich and varied one. As Supervising Judges are engaged in their own professional work, the range of support that the Clerks can provide can vary depending on the types of cases that come before the Judges.\n\n5. All Clerks must be prepared to take ownership of their own learning and time management by capitalising on opportunities for learning, discussion and reflection. Clerks are required to find opportunities to complete the list of minimum tasks listed in paragraph 14 of this syllabus, and are encouraged to add to the list as the opportunity arises."

        "description": "It is fair to say that few branches of the law have, in recent times, developed as swiftly and explosively across jurisdictions as the law of intellectual property (IP). In Singapore, this is evidenced by the Government’s push for a sound and comprehensive legal framework for the promotion and protection of IP, and by the setting up of the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS) and the IP Academy. More recently, several amendments were made to Singapore’s IP legislation in order to implement the country’s obligations under the United States – Singapore Free Trade Agreement.\n\nYou will, in this course, be introduced to the different types of IP rights and the various branches of IP law, in particular the law of copyright, patents and trademarks. Apart from learning the fundamental principles of IP law and the impact of international IP conventions and treaties, we will have the opportunity to explore, from a comparative perspective, the various policy issues which underpin much of the IP debate – in particular, controversies surrounding the protection, exploitation and enforcement of IP rights. Through group project work and presentations, we shall also examine how the IP regime operates in appropriate Asian jurisdictions and assess whether the protection and enforcement mechanisms in these jurisdictions measure up to international norms and standards.\n\nThe study of IP was, until quite recently, a somewhat esoteric specialisation. Today, IP occupies a central position in the global, knowledge-based economy and this course should therefore appeal to those who wish to equip themselves with knowledge of a burgeoning and highly relevant area of the law."

Entities whose support of  the proposed foreign investment venture, such as banks, suppliers, and customers, would also need to be assured that the political risk has been reduced by situating the proposed venture in the framework of applicable foreign investment law."

The preliminary discussions and meetings, however, take place via email and video-conference with all parties in their home countries.  The mediation occurs and the parties reach a settlement, which the parties’ legal representatives draft into contractual form. Such cross-border mediations involve:\n• international and intercultural competencies;\n• online and face-to-face mediation processes and protocols; and\n• knowledge of the applicable law in relation to the substantive and procedural aspects of mediation.\n\nThis course offers you a framework for understanding cross-border mediation law and practice and the opportunity to develop specialised mediation skills relevant to cross-border settings. Simulated role-play exercises are arranged to develop your skills as a mediator.\n\nUpon successful completion of the course and related assessment, participants will be able to apply to the Singapore International Mediation Institute (SIMI) for mediator accreditation. Participants who wish to do so may inform SIDRA staff at learning@sidra.academy. SIDRA will verify the results of the assessment and refer the participant’s application to SIMI.

Open outcry trading floors at exchanges have been replaced by automated trade matching and straight-thru-processing (STP) has replaced error-prone paper-based settlements processing resulting in shorter settlement cycles.\n\nBut amid the loss of colorful trading jackets and the hype around technological advances, the fundamentals of markets, trading and risk management have not changed.  And in order to provide products and services salient to the financial market community, one must understand these fundamentals.\n\nThis course introduces the roles within the types of markets, products and services, and how associated risks are harnessed and managed.  Focus will be placed on the foreign exchange and equities products and the processes that support the trading and settlement of these instruments. The course will include the schematic architecture and design of the systems that support these processes. Learners will be placed in multiple simulations, taking on different roles from broker, to trader to risk manager, allowing them to gain insights to the practical application of what otherwise remains theory."

The real and hypothesized risks of AI are considered, alongside AI’s capabilities and applications across different sectors and industries. This is followed by an examination into the definition of ethics, current ethical codes and frameworks, and the role of ethics as providing a self-regulatory frame for the creation of fair, explainable, transparent, non-discriminatory AI systems.\n\nThe course then moves into an exploration of both mainstream and alternative approaches to AI ethics. Students are guided to explore ethical theories such as utilitarianism, non-consequentialism, and virtue ethics. Underrepresented perspectives on AI ethics such as vulnerability theory, posthumanism, postcolonialism theory and eco-justice are also examined. These discussions enable students to consider the theories they find most relevant and fitting for AI ethics and for managing AI systems. Additionally, by engaging and critically evaluating with these perspectives, students are encouraged to cultivate a deeper appreciation of the barriers associated with translating these ethical principles into practice.\n\nMoving on, the course is interested in the operation of AI and technology in the legal sphere. The impact, opportunities, and challenges associated with the deployment of AI in the legal sphere are traced, followed by an investigation into the emerging legal issues associated with AI applications. Questions of interest here include the responsibility and liability of AI systems, the impact of AI on individual rights and liberties, the emergence of AI-enabled crime, AI’s interference with an accused’s due process rights, and the influence of AI on Democracy and the Rule of Law. In subsequent classes, real-life case studies are cited to present the ethical issues and challenges associated with the application of AI in practice. The case studies explore themes associated with the erosion of privacy and surveillance, the determination of justice and fairness, the threat to human dignity, issues of misinformation and (dis)trust, responsible innovation, and the power and accountability of State and big tech companies.\n\nThe above determined issues are all examined in light of current legal regimes managing contemporary AI systems. Students are asked to assess the adequacy of current legal frameworks alongside limitations of AI ethical frameworks. They are led to recognise how the pace in which AI is advancing and transforming the world means that existing laws are quickly becoming outdated. The limitations associated with AI ethical frameworks would also quickly become apparent prompting the question of what next and where do we go from here?\n\nThese regulatory gaps challenge the safe use of technology opening pathways for the abuse and exploitation of new technologies. Increasing calls have been made seeking innovative regulatory models that go beyond self-regulatory or voluntary AI ethics governance frames. Yet, on the other hand, concerns surrounding how over-regulation will stifle innovation continue to emerge. In our final classes, we look at various AI governance approaches – in Asia and beyond – and explore current regulatory initiatives, as well as, more innovative regulatory frames."

        "description": "We interact with a variety of services and systems in our daily lives. While manual labors still take some part in those systems, some other parts become more and more automated by artificial intelligence (AI). In general, we might expect that those systems treat users fairly. If the system uses AI that is built on big data and complex algorithms, such expectation would be strengthened. Compared to human labor that might involve subjective decision-making, algorithmic systems are expected to objectively work and treat users fairly. However, in recent years, there are raising concerns about the potential harms of those systems, which are rooted in biases embedded in socio-technical systems. The inherent opaque nature of AI systems makes the problem worse.\nFor example, YouTube recommends next videos when a video is finished playing. Those recommendations, on the one hand, are helpful to find interesting videos from a tremendous number of YouTube videos, but on the other hand, it is often unclear how or why the video is recommended. What happens if some biases exist in the recommendation algorithm, such as favoring videos with a specific (political) view? No matter whether those biases are intentional or unintentional, users would be exposed to a certain set of videos and are likely to be influenced by them. \nYouTube is only one out of many examples because AI systems are becoming pervasive these days. In various areas, including healthcare, hiring, financial service, ads, policymaking, and internet services, AI systems are actively used. Thus, it is crucial to ensure that those systems are working fairly without any potential biases. It might be overlooked that the biases are embedded not only in the AI systems but also in established processes or human operators within the systems.\nThe goal of this course is to provide students with an extensive understanding of diverse concepts of fairness and bias in socio-technical systems through examples across diverse domains, from healthcare to internet search. Then, students will learn how to audit practical systems in terms of fairness and bias through recent case studies. The course also aims to understand public concerns related to AI systems and help students to deeply think about ethical AI within multiple social contexts."

Past slogans like \"move fast and break things\" led tech companies to overlook harms, as evidenced by scandals involving user data misuse and workplace culture issues.\n\nThere is now broader recognition that responsible innovation requires understanding potential risks and aligning with human values. But how can we ensure that technology advances in a manner that's ethical, sustainable, and beneficial for all?\n\nThis timely course explores ethics in computing. Through case studies and frameworks, students will develop skills in critical and nuanced thinking about complex issues at the intersection of technology and society.\n\nWhat you will find in this course:\n- Embracing Complexity: We won't seek single \"right\" answers. Instead, we'll foster a space for exploring multidimensional problems with interconnected tradeoffs, encouraging students to understand, appreciate, and engage with differing viewpoints.\n- Skill Development: Students will practise not just theory but systematic analysis of real-world impacts, preparing them for the consequential decisions they may face in their future careers.\n- Structured Exploration: The course is divided into two engaging parts. The first introduces fundamental concepts, while the second dives into contemporary dilemmas, exposing the tensions between responsible development and disruptive innovation.\n- Respectful Discourse: A commitment to respectful dialogue is central to this course. We recognise the intricate and \"messy\" nature of real-world problems, with ramifications extending far into a dynamic and uncertain technological future.\n- Distinct Focus on Technology: While courses like \"COR3301 Ethics and Social Responsibility\" provide a broad understanding of ethical conduct across various professions, this course specialises in the intersection of technology and ethics. This course targets the unique challenges of the digital age, equipping tech professionals with the nuanced understanding needed to navigate ethical dilemmas specific to computing, AI, and digital human rights. It's a tailored exploration for those aiming to align technological advancements with responsible decision-making.\n- Empowering Future Leaders: By attuning students to ethical imperatives and responsible decision-making processes, this course prepares the next generation of tech professionals to navigate and guide technological progress in a manner that honours human values and serves the greater good."

This forecasting is valuable in plotting the ethical, social, and legal ramifications of said eventualities and determining optimal regulatory oversight.\n\nMore so than other types of stories, dystopian film and television provide highly visual and memorable touchstones for society to discuss complex technological ideas. Consider the recently popular television anthology series Black Mirror, which first aired in 2011.  Many of the show’s most disturbing episodes feature seemingly futuristic technologies such as devices that wire directly into the human brain and present the potential consequences thereof. Surprisingly, such revolutionary technologies are not so far off.   A great example of this convergence is Elon Musk’s Neuralink Corp. which recently announced a similar device to the one in Black Mirror, the  pending ability of Neuralink’s implanted brain chip to allow people to “listen to music directly from our chips […or] control hormone levels and use them to our advantage.”\n\nGiven the warp speed at which fiction and non-fiction appear to be colliding, there are clear teaching opportunities in employing dystopian film and television programs in the areas of pedagogy focused on the intersection between law and technology.  \n\nThis course will look to Hollywood’s view of dystopia as a jumping off point to analyze the intersection between law and emerging technologies.   The course will focus mostly on the Black Mirror series, but will also look to other shows and film as well."

Knowledge about the key areas of commercial laws in the two largest economies in the world will get students better prepared for cross-border transaction practices. At the same time, these two jurisdictions are also chosen for their distinctive characters in their legal and regulatory frameworks. The corporate and securities laws in China reflect a mixture of its civil law tradition, British law influence through Hong Kong, and American law impact as a result of the bulk of Chinese scholars and regulators studying in the U.S..  On the other hand, despite its common law heritage, the U.S. corporate and securities laws have developed along a unique track due to competition among states and unparalleled depth of its capital market. The topics to be discussed are chosen mainly from the Chinese perspective, with their functional equivalents in the U.S. law are compared. The purpose of the course is threefold.  First, we will learn the basic rules of corporate and securities laws in China and the U.S.. Second, we will understand the social and economic rationales underlying the different rules and practices in these two jurisdictions.

As environmental and social problems mount around the world, firms have become more attuned to the need to devise new products, services and strategies, and to communicate these to a variety of stakeholders, even as they cooperate with them.\n\nEnvironmental sustainability, and more generally, sustainability, has become increasingly important to developed and developing nations alike. Typical issues include resource scarcity and polluted environments, but more recently, global climate change has become the primary issue for many. In general, sustainability issues often consist of complex interactions between human activity and the environment. The course will apply several academic perspectives to characterizing these problems and their possible solutions.\n\nThe course will focus in particular on businesses’ role in causing and addressing sustainability problems and on how they moderate their impacts. An important part of addressing the sustainability of firms is the employment of various concepts and frameworks that help incorporate the sustainability perspective into firms’ strategies and operations. To help characterize firms’ sustainability and determine appropriate courses of action, the course will cover specific managerial tools and frameworks. The primary focus will be on strategy and business models that support change and its operationalization, but the course will also illustrate the role that “greening” other business functions play in the sustainability of the firm, including those of marketing, supply chains, and financing. The course will review core management frameworks to help non-business major students become familiar with more sustainability-specific frameworks, practices and concepts to be covered. These tools are not only means for improving a firm’s sustainability performance, but also support its transparent and effective reporting. Representative examples of sustainability measurement standards will be introduced and their potential impacts in advancing corporate sustainability will be discussed. The course will also reflect on the general role of innovation in all of this. Technology issues covered include the role of information technology in addressing poverty, and solutions that reorganize the industrial system (e.g. renewable energy policies, and industrial ecosystems or industrial symbiosis, i.e., industries that incorporate recycling loops at regional levels)."

        "description": "To achieve superior performance in an increasingly dynamic and uncertain global business environment, companies in every industry must create internal capability to harness strategic change for sustainable competitive advantage. However, companies that are able to strategically change their entrenched ways of doing things and then reclaim leading positions are the exception rather than the rule. With the industry 4.0 upon us and fast advancement in digital technologies, firms in many industries would find it even more pressing but challenging to build the managerial capabilities to cope with the digital transformation that will reshape the business landscape tremendously for the future. Against this backdrop, this course discusses how companies can effectively manage the strategic change and digital transformation that will significantly impact the way the business is configured for competitive advantage. Besides the internal managerial challenge, the course also emphasizes that companies must cope with strategic interactions with different industry players to create value collectively and continuously. With respect to digital transformation, the course discusses digital concepts and technologies such as omni-channel, platforms, eco-systems, blockchain, IOT, AI, and cloud computing etc. that impose both challenges and opportunities for strategic change management in the increasingly technology-based, internet-based, and data-based business contexts."

        "description": "This course will explore how ‘play’ can enhance creative design processes to promote innovation and invention. Play was borne out of not only human desires for leisure and frivolity, but cultural and biological needs such as learning and community bonding. Recently, it has been observed that inventors in history have conceived of new ideas and products, even technological inventions, in a playful manner (Johnson, 2016). Playful invention processes could be serious experimental (and risky) efforts, or playfully frivolous ones. The course will analyze and apply creative and inventive processes, with the focus on how the mind can explore more widely and inventively by becoming less self-conscious and critical through play.\n\nPlayful invention facilitates creativity by blending ideas together from different domains, causing ‘forms’ to transcend boundaries, and ultimately, to reshape not only leisure, but other domains and culture itself. This creative blending helps cross-fertilize domains with new ideas. We will examine how inventors ‘playfully created’ in different domains such as narrative, visual arts, space (including architectural space), and games. While most of the cultural domains covered relate to historical and current popular culture, we also pay attention to specific local and ‘globalized national’ cultures.\n\nAt least half of the course focuses on the actual practice of techniques that are related to the conceptual study of domains and thinking processes. We will adapt the design thinking process to incorporate additional brainstorming techniques (including domain-specific ideation techniques) and user-centered prototyping while removing the ‘project client’ typically seen in design thinking projects. In addition, we will illustrate and practice how to design using domains as lenses into the design of forms related to those domains.\n\nA significant part of the course will involve a project to design an innovative experience or other ‘form’ using these creativity and design techniques. In-class (or online) group exercises and projects will be used to demonstrate and practice these techniques, and full class attendance is expected in order to participate in these group exercises and group work."

Without law, said Thomas Hobbes, life would be nasty, brutish, and short. The Hobbesian reference to automata has also been identified as one of earliest conceptions of artificial intelligence. Thus began a long entanglement between law and computing technologies. The first people to “Code” were lawyers, not programmers. Leibniz, famous for inventing calculus, held a doctorate in law. So too did Schumpeter, the ‘father’ of innovation theory.\n\nBut lawyers today are not known for technological competence. Google “why are lawyers bad at” and autocomplete suggests “math”.  US lawmakers hauled Facebook before them only to explain how the internet works.  And the US Supreme Court, suggests Nate Silver, is “allergic” to statistics.  These are the people responsible for writing, interpreting, and in some sense enforcing the laws that govern technology.\n\nThis course aim to plug the puzzling chasm between lawyers and technologists by introducing tomorrow’s lawyers to what technology is and how it is regulated by, and itself regulates, law. We will cover four key themes in particular:\n\n1. The History of Law and Technology\n2. Regulating The New Web\n3. Artificial Intelligence and Law\n4. Legal Technology\n\nIndividual readings will be assigned each week.  The overarching goal is to initiate students to the growing world of law and technology and equip them with the basic skills and vocabulary for more focused electives and self-study."

In particular, we will discuss whether the distinction between common law and civil law that is prominent in comparative private law also has value for constitutional law. The third class will deal with judicial review of legislation. We will start from the fundamental legitimacy problem that the judiciary faces when reviewing acts of the legislature and examine the different responses that constitutions have found to address this problem. The fourth part addresses the structure of government. We will not only analyze different ways how governments are accountable to their citizens, but also look at empirical evidence on the economic effects of governance design choices. The fifth part deals with fundamental rights and addresses in particular the structure of the fundamental rights analyses. In many jurisdictions, the proportionality test is at the heart of the fundamental rights analysis. We will look at how proportionality varies according to different constitutional contexts and also look at functional equivalents in jurisdictions that have not adopted the proportionality test.

The 21 economies of the largest trans-Pacific grouping, Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC), account for nearly half of global trade. The region comprises not only the world’s ‘factory floor’ but also its most important sources of services, technology and investments, and final goods markets,” writes Peter Petri, an international trade economist.   Yet despite the much celebrated economic progress of the region and the potential to be reaped from it, there are clear strains and risks resulting from geopolitical and economic trends which impact businesses that operate here.\n\nThis course consists of a set of core lectures which will introduce students to: (a) economic, political and socio-cultural theories and frameworks for understanding the context of business in the Asia Pacific region; and (b) the application of international business theories and frameworks to understand the decision-making processes of companies investing in the region. Course participants are expected to apply theories and frameworks to assess business environments of specific Asian economies.  Participants are expected to analyse and make presentations about issues and challenges that are relevant to companies operating in large emerging economies such as China, India, Taiwan, and South Korea but also other economies such as Myanmar, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam."

We will contrast findings, practices and lessons learnt when analyzing the effects of resource scarcity, environmental and societal stress, demographic change, diversity, globalization and the economic system. Further, we will explore developments in key technology areas (artificial intelligence, big data, biotech, nanotech, ITC, internet security and space technology) and debate implications on Singapore’s transition into a knowledge- and innovation-based economy. Special topics on “Closed & Finite System Thinking”, “Non-linear Behavior”, “Culture” and “Risk Mitigation” complement the course. Trends are internalized through examples and a research project to ascertain a solid understanding of ongoing debates.

The sanctions imposed by the US Department of Justice / the US Securities Exchange Commission and the UK Serious Fraud Office typically run in the tens of millions of dollars. Notably, between 2010 and 2021, the monetary penalties imposed exceeded US$15 billion dollars.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, this course examines the prohibitions, rules and standards that govern transnational corruption laws and anti-bribery compliance law and practice.\n\nThe course will start by generally examining the ethos and expectations of the key regulators / enforcers before reviewing the FCPA and UK Bribery Act. It will also consider the importance of internal controls and the components of an effective anti-bribery compliance (“ABC”) program. We then examine the use of deferred prosecution agreements, and non-prosecution agreements by regulators. We go on to analyse case studies of instances of corruption (e.g., Siemens AG, Rolls Royce, Goldman Sachs etc). In the last part of the course, we consider the need to create and implement internal controls and ABC programs that go beyond the letter of the law (e.g., codes of ethics, social responsibility standards, and the creation of institutional culture of compliance)."

The course also familiarizes students with how best to present their market validation information and the initial outlines of their business and revenue models on social platforms and to early-stage investors.\n\nThe course will guide students in the process of developing and market-testing new venture ideas. Students will work in teams, and each team will receive a grant of $700 towards prototyping and market testing their new venture idea. Also, mentors will give the team feedback on their market testing process.\n\nStudent teams (3 tor 5 students per team) can be preformed before the course or can be formed in the first three weeks of the course. If you have an idea but lack team members, or you lack an idea but would like to join a team visit this web page https://smu.sg/1lq to post your ideas and seek team members or views ideas and to join originators of ideas as team members. If you are interested in the course and want to find team members please send an email to adamequek@smu.edu.sg with the header ‘Entrepreneurship Practicum”.\n\nThe student team business idea should be scalable, i.e., the aspiration of the student team should be to have at least 10 employees or $1 million in revenue within five years. If the business is a social entrepreneurship, a similar metric for social impact as appropriate will be encouraged.  Student teams, as pre-formed, will remain the same for the duration of the course. Any disagreements within a team will have to be resolved by the team members themselves.\n\nThis course is not for students with more mature businesses; students who already have a business with finished products and/or services and with customers are encouraged to approach SMU-IIE for entry into the incubation program."

For those graduates who choose a start-up or SME, there is also a government initiative to encourage more Singaporean firms to establish operations overseas so it is important to understand the challenges and process of doing so. Accordingly, this Capstone course integrates content drawn from practice and research on establishing a business overseas and managing a multinational, as well as, an X-Culture SMU-X experiential exercise with a real company so the student:\n\n1. Understands the topology of differences (cognitive, cultural, nation state, institutional, business systems, market economies, economic maturity, and geographic) that exists, particularly, among countries in Asia, and must be accommodated within an internationalised business model as SMEs/MNCs establish operations outside their home country.\n\n2. Builds upon their prior courses, particularly business strategy, to understand the process of formulating and operationalising a strategy to internationalise towards foreign markets, as well as, the considerations and trade-offs when executing those steps. This will include an understanding of the roles and management interactions of locals versus expatriates, as well as, among host country subsidiaries, regional offices, and corporate headquarters. Emphasis is applied to understanding the strategic advantages possessed by a multinational; their ability to transfer such advantages from its home to host markets; as well as, the capacity of corporate headquarters to absorb new knowledge from its foreign operations in order to sustain and enhance its engagement within Asia.\n\n3. Experiences what it is like to work in a MNC by applying a cross-disciplinary approach as a member of a global cross-cultural team. After all, reading a textbook does not allow a true appreciation of the reality of international cross-cultural business collaboration – one must experience it! You will apply both the course content and your accumulated academic knowledge at SMU in providing recommendations to a real-life SME as to a new market entry strategy (or similar assignment) encompassing market selection, entry method, marketing and operational considerations. As a participant in this global X-Culture initiative the SMU student will work in teams drawn among 5,000 students from 150 participating universities within 40 countries around the globe. After the successful completion of the exercise, in addition to the normal SMU grade, students will receive a X-Culture certificate, a performance report, and a recommendation letter reflecting your performance. The best teams will also be invited to the X-Culture Global Symposium held in July each year.\n\nConsistent with SMU’s experiential and formative teaching pedagogy, there will be three short quizzes throughout the term to promote greater knowledge retention (there is no final exam). In addition, you will choose your own local SMU teams to participate in the ‘Great SMU Debate’ and a case study prior to embarking on the X-Culture experiential exercise with your global teams during the second part of the course."

It seeks to provide students with an understanding of the key principles in this key component of commercial law.\n\nThe course will primarily focus on Singapore and English law – the London insurance market is traditionally regarded as the industry leader in the development of insurance law and practice. Notably, Lloyd's of London and the London Company Market insure risks placed all over the globe. As such, English law has an outsized influence in the development of insurance law and practice.\n\nStudents can expect to have a wider comprehension of risk assessment and assess the terms of contracts of insurance with a view to protecting the interests of the insured at the conclusion of a contract of insurance."

In particular, this course is designed to give students a flavour of what life is like as a transactional lawyer working on a general banking transaction.\n\nOver the weeks, students will be walked through the lifecycle of a fictitious watered-down financing transaction. As the transaction progresses, students will gradually be introduced to the various financing legal documents (eg, term sheets, loan facility agreements, corporate authorisations) and their key clauses. Crucially, students will also step into the shoes of lender’s counsel and be given several opportunities to “hold the pen” – students will be tasked to take instructions from their clients and draft/review certain financing legal documents. Finally, students will participate and lead an all-parties call to iron out the outstanding issues blocking the transaction from closing.\n\nThrough this course, students will have the opportunity to both gain insights on transactional lawyering, as well as learn practical skills that will better prepare students to transition to their upcoming lives as practice trainees and junior associates. Moreover, while this course is conducted in the context of banking and finance, the practical skills taught in this course will nonetheless be largely applicable to other fields of transactional law, including but not limited to mergers and acquisitions, investment funds, capital markets etc."

However, engaging in multiple roles also has benefits for individuals and organizations. Drawing especially on current academic research and global organizational practices, students are provided with a broad overview of related topics by exposing them to a variety of theories, concepts, findings, and unresolved issues within this area. Multiple activities will help students identify individual preferences for roles, gain skills to better balance of roles, and create a modifiable, goal-directed framework related to their current and future selves."

This transition is claimed already to be in train in many common law jurisdictions – it is ‘the direction of regulatory travel’ – and the technological management regulatory paradigm now seems particularly salient in light of myriad advances in computation and AI. Drawing and interrogating the contrast between the two paradigms will allow us to see and evaluate the assumptions and benefits of each as well as their disadvantages. We will examine the contrast both in general terms, in our early classes, and then in particular contexts, such as private law and the practice of adjudication, in later classes."

Within banks we have many sub types ranging from consumer or retail banks to investment banks. This course will focus on the banks as they generate significant jobs and are major contributors to the GDP.\n\nBanks offer digital banking business products, processes and services to institutional and individual customers to enable them to transact for their personal needs or business needs. They include: save and invest surplus funds; obtain financing for ongoing business and personal needs; pay and receive money; conduct international trade activities; and manage financial risk with options and derivatives for hedging. Customer assets held in bank accounts, transactions involving these accounts, and related information and privacy require total and continuous security and protection. \n\nThis course is structured based on two inter-related modules that are built up sequentially:\n\n1. Banking Foundation – The Essential Concepts\n2. Digital Trends and Applications to Banking in Digital Transformation"

        "description": "This course aims to introduce PLE students to how law operates in Singapore. We will explore the role of law in Singapore in the management of both public power and the sphere of private dealings between persons. This will be done through a study of the various sources of law and their nature; the legal institutions and the relations between them; and foundational principles and values.\n\nWe will begin by exploring the concept of law and the ideals of constitutionalism, democracy, the rule of law, and the separation of powers – all of which pertain to the ways in which power is defined and limited by law. Besides studying what law is, we will study tools and concepts which have some degree of formality but are not law, such as policies and decisions by those who hold discretionary powers.\n\nHaving inquired into these ideas, we will go on to explore the various institutions of the state and their roles, as well as the values that animate them. This is important because law does not put itself into action; legal institutions breathe life into laws by interpreting them, executing them, and serving as sites of contestation as to how they are to be interpreted and executed. We will discuss matters such as different modes of lawmaking and their relative advantages and disadvantages; the role of the state in controlling its own power; and the limits to law as a means of governing society. Finally, we will apply all this knowledge by focusing our attention on a few discrete areas of law as case studies.\n\nWhile this course will focus on Singapore, comparisons will be drawn with other legal systems, particularly the UK’s, when appropriate."

To assist them, the financial services industry is collecting ever increasing amounts of data from their internal processes, customers and services, and applying state-of-the-art artificial intelligence algorithms to find value and service automation.\nThe knowledge and understanding that are needed for an artificial intelligence and data analytics professional in financial services includes, but is not limited to, data management, analysis, mathematics and statistics, machine learning and deep learning as well as an intimate knowledge of the specific financial services domain including the regulations and compliance surrounding it.\nThis module aims to bring these skills and knowledge together to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence techniques and their applications in financial services.\nUsing state-of-the-art artificial intelligence algorithms coupled with class discussion, labs and guest speakers from the industry, the students can understand how domain knowledge (such as compliance and regulation) interacts with artificial intelligence solutions and value chains through a range of industry cases.\nThis module is also designed to take advantage of the diversity in students’ background to give varied points-of-view during each lab project and discussion. This closely emulates many financial services artificial intelligence environments. To ensure students have the required level of knowledge and skills, pre-requisites are set.\n\nAfter completion of the module, students will be able to identify potential areas within the current financial services landscape shaped by local and regional regulators. Be able to state the challenges and potential artificial intelligence solutions that could be applied, and the relevant legal and ethical considerations associated. Students will be able to implement the chosen solution from inception to production. This will give students a significant edge in their financial services career."

It is designed to allow students to translate classroom knowledge into professional experience. It is a unique oppor-tunity to learn more about consulting services and apply theoretical knowledge to a real business project. The core focus of this class rests on a group work built around a real world business project offered by one of our corpo-rarte partners. For each session (G1 and G2), we are collaborating with more than twelve different corporate partners with each student group benefitting from an exclusive relationship to their own corporate partner. The corporate projects cover different industries and different topics. Students are invited to share their preferences with which corporate partner (and thereby in which industry or on what topic focus) they wish to work and gain experience.\n\nThis SMU-X course is a combination of advanced in-class learning and practical interaction with the business world via project work and guest lecturers who work/have worked with major consultancy companies such as McKinsey, BCG, or Bain. The lectures introduce the world of consulting by teaching the basic steps and tools used during the consulting process. You will learn how consultants frame, analyse and solve problems and how they present their solutions to their clients. You will obtain tools and frameworks to reduce complexity and structure a project. Sev-eral mini cases and lived situations with your corporate partner will help you to develop an understanding of how to approach a business project and manage the relationship with your corporate partner as a client. Guest lectures will provide you with industry insights and hands-on experiences about the day-to-day business of a consultant.\n\nThe unique opportunity to explore, learn, and directly apply competencies in a real life, multidisciplinary, team-based consulting experience with a company/organization is the distinguishing feature of this course. You will be working in teams for (large) corporations or smaller startups, acting as student consultants working on real challenges the organizations presently face. The solutions you develop will be presented to the senior management of the compa-nies. In previous semesters, our corporate partners included DBS (banking), Adidas (sports apparel), WWF (nature conservancy), Nestlé (nutrition), SingPost (logistics), Lufthansa (airline), CapitaLand (real estate), Sygnum (fintech), Lazada (E-commerce) and many more."

When banks misprice risk associated with financial products or take on too much risk, they endanger their overall profitability. Likewise, when legal and regulatory compliance  are mismanaged, banks can incur substantial fines, suffer reputational damage, and become subject to ongoing regulatory scrutiny. Accordingly, efficient and effective management of risk and regulatory compliance is a core focus for banks' management. Because of its mathematical nature, risk calculation, extensively leveraged technology for several decades. On the other hand, a long-standing approach that banks have used to deal with gaps in regulatory compliance and increasing regulation has been to \"throw more bodies\" at the problem.  This approach has been costly, inefficient, and, in some cases, ineffective.  As a result, Regtech solutions have been developed that help banks use technology to address compliance-related challenges.\n\nThis course begins by providing an introduction to Risktech, technology that is used to support banks' risk management activities.  It reviews the main types of risks that banks encounter: market risk, credit risk, and operational risk and the processes and techniques used to measure those risks. Challenges related to managing risk data and performing risk calculations are reviewed along with related technology approaches.  The course then goes on to review the purpose and application of bank regulation and common causes of regulatory compliance failure.

Sustainability practitioners must not only help develop (i.e., design) and sell a sustainable product or service, but an entire mind-set, and where necessary, to devise changes in business models and operations. The course will guide students, working in teams, through a development process involving market and strategic assessment, positioning of the product (including its sustainability attributes), customer-centric design, and business model innovation. This will in turn lead students to develop value propositions and marketing, which will be presented in a final pitch session to the client’s representatives. The primary methodology will consist of design thinking techniques, which will be broadly used and adapted to the sustainability context. Phases of design include the understanding of candidate consumers’ (users’) needs by qualitative means, creation of basic product concepts and prototypes, and the testing and validation of prototypes with users. Implications will also be drawn for the client’s business model. Note that the course may be more time-intensive than a content-based or normal SMU-X course, as it centers on a project with a methodology (design thinking), but also involves content on sustainability and business, and involves some use of analytical techniques such as secondary market research (e.g. assembling of data on consumer segment numbers). Note that the data and analysis may change depending on the client involved.

        "description": "At the end of 1945, the areas bordering the Straits of Malacca were facing recovery from wartime destruction and the sharp decline of colonial rule.  Indonesia, the largest and most geographically widespread, in 1945 was the first to become independent.  Formed in 1948, the Federation of Malaya became independent in 1957.  The city state of Singapore broke off from Malaya and became independent in 1965.  At this point, these three post-colonial countries were at somewhat similar levels of development (although the British had treated Singapore as an urban center and a major port -- not an agricultural resource).  All three were low income countries with per capita GDP ranging from $56 in Indonesia, $333 in Malaysia to $516 in Singapore.  Indonesia and Malaysia possessed significant natural resources, whereas Singapore (now cut off from Malaysia) was bereft even of water.  Over the past fifty years, the political and economic choices made in the three countries have varied, and their growth trajectories diverged.  Today, per capita GDP varies greatly:  Indonesia, $3,491; Malaysia, $11,307; and Singapore, $56,284 (World Bank data).\n\nThese three countries have pursued different pathways which to some extent can be explained by economic drivers, but also by government policy choices with regard to inclusive growth.  The course will consider this in the context of business in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, and will study it from multiple perspectives:  government, corporate/family business, and social impact. To examine this in a one-week timeframe, we will focus on the development of infrastructure, real estate (housing), education and health care.\n \nResource-rich environments attract investors, but managing today in countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia where governments are sensitive to issues of competitive and strategic sustainability, raises challenges.  Having moved from low income status to low middle-middle income status, Indonesia and Malaysia face the challenge of avoiding the “middle-income trap,” the situation where developing economies’ convergence to the development frontier comes to a halt once their income per capita reaches a middle-income level.  In contrast, Singapore surmounted that challenged, but now as an advanced market economy, it faces the challenge of a small, high wage country (5.5 million): the need to innovate to remain competitive at this level."

Multiple steps of approvals may be required to fulfil an order, followed by arrangement of shipments to the customers. Invoices are also digitally captured, and payment received via various online means. In the real-world businesses, processes are highly complex, dynamic (evolving over time) and uncertain (subject to random events and behaviours).\n\nProcess analytics is a field of analytics that includes understanding the business processes in an organization, analysing process performances, evaluating the resources consumed and developing improved ones that help organizations operate more efficiently and effectively.  Based on this key principle, this course covers two major topics -- Process Mining and Process Simulation. \n\nProcess Mining is a technique to discover processes and characterise them in process models. Graph modeling and machine learning algorithms are applied to discover business processes from the event execution data. This data-driven technique can provide the ground truth (of the actual execution) rather than relying on an idealized process model. It can also identify the bottlenecks and opportunities for improving the processes. From the process models, we combine the ground truth and expert’s view to design the new to-be processes. As the real-world process are typically challenging to be modelled mathematically, simulation becomes the only feasible tool to examine the alternatives. By incorporating the data models from the actual process execution, process simulation helps decision-makers to arrive at evidence-based conclusions by visualizing, analysing and optimizing their processes.\n\nThis course covers the Descriptive, Predictive and Prescriptive analytics by modeling and simulating the behaviour of real-world business processes. You will be introduced to both the theoretical background and applications of process mining and simulation. Topics covered include data mining the process events, applying machine learning methods to derive the processes, abstracting real-world process as a digital replica, statistical analysis of the simulation models and introductory concepts of digital twin. The skills and competencies you learned will be applicable to various industries such as manufacturing, retail, healthcare, and many more."

Big Data is helping provide richer and newer insights into questions analytics has been answering by modeling for a richer customer and operations scenario. \n\nAs such, it is incumbent on practitioners of advance analytics to be intimately familiar with technologies that help store, manage and analyze these Big Data streams (sensor data, text data, image data etc.) in an integrated way along with more traditional data sets (e.g. CRM, ERP etc.)\n\nThis course is intended to equip students with an appreciation and a working knowledge of Big Data technologies that are prevalent in the market today along with how and when to use Big Data technologies for specific scenarios. This course will provide a foundation to the Hadoop framework (HDFS, MapReduce) along with Hadoop ecosystem components (Pig, Hive, Spark and Kafka). The course will also cover key Big Data architectures from the point of view of both on-premise environments and public cloud deployments."

        "description": "This course initiative rests on the assumption that there is a powerful synergy between ‘sustainability’ and ‘innovation’ in business and society. The term ‘sustainable innovation’ refers to the creation of new market space, products and services or processes driven by social, environmental or sustainability concerns. Just like general innovation, sustainable innovation goes way beyond incremental improvements of products, services or processes. The challenge is to proactively embrace risk management and sustainability considerations (environmental, social, financial) aimed at aligning (novel) business strategies with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to create and capture new value. If managed well by results-oriented, socially aware sustainability leaders, sustainable innovation results not only in greater effectiveness at (intra)organisational levels but also helps to create a cleaner, healthier, fairer (and hopefully more stable) world as envisaged by the circular economy. The urgent need for sustainability has never been greater as evidenced by rapid population growth, pollution, (toxic) waste, plastic accumulating in our oceans, limited natural resources, climate change etc. This course will introduce students to the managerial discipline of innovation management with particular reference to examples of ‘good’ / ‘best’ sustainable innovation practices adopted by both local and international organisations such as City Development Limited (CDL), Banyan Tree, Sustainability Center Freiburg (launched in 2015 by the University of Freiburg in cooperation with five Fraunhofer research institutes), Henkel BeautyCare (whose Social Plastic Ecosystem in partnership with the Plastic Bank social enterprise is aimed at stopping ocean plastic and simultaneously providing opportunities for people in poverty), Procter & Gamble’s Tide Eco-Box (which contains less packaging, 60% less plastic and 30% less water than the current Tide press-tap) and many more."

Many are setting up family offices to facilitate this succession planning and wealth transfer.\n\nFamily offices are privately owned entities that manage the private wealth and other affairs of the family including philanthropy, education, and estate planning. In Singapore, family offices are required to have at least $10 million of assets under management (AUM), with many more than $100 million in AUM. Beyond managing the family wealth, the family office also supports the family’s vision and legacy, and helps to support important transitions in ownership, leadership, and wealth.\n\nSingapore has gained prominence as the preferred base for family offices, with their numbers doubling to 400 in 2020 as compared to the year before. This trend is expected to continue. Family offices by nature are private, closely held entities. However, with the phenomenal increase in the number of family offices, there is a corresponding spike in demand for professionals familiar with managing the family office.\n\nThe BFI Family Office Management Work-Study Elective is a collaboration with family offices and their advisors that will provide students with the opportunity to undergo a 5-month extended internship programme in a partner company. Most family offices are led by family principals and staffed by small teams of senior professionals with decades of experience.\n\nHence, the work-study elective presents valuable opportunities for students to take on a broader range of responsibilities and to learn directly from senior management, compared to junior internships at a larger corporate organization.\n\nThe BFI Family Office Management Work-Study Elective involves an internship locally, where students enrolled will work for at least four days each week at the host company and take courses on campus for up to one day each week for up to five months.\n\nWhile undertaking this elective, students may enroll in up to 2 course units (CU) of courses, as long as there is no timetable clash with the internship requirements.\n\nThis Work-Study Elective is open to all SMU students who meet the pre-requisites."

A quick search across the internet shows that the benefits of entrepreneurship include but are not limited to the following: accelerating economic growth, promoting innovation, promoting social changes, promoting research and industrial development, and developing and improving existing enterprises. Start-ups and small businesses also have a disproportionate impact on job creation, accounting for 64% of new jobs and contributing to 20 percent of gross job creation. , , , ,\n\nIn Singapore, a survey in 2012 as part of a Global Entrepreneurship Monitoring study indicates that 21.4% of people in Singapore intend to start a company in the next three years, ranked second among OECD countries.  This indicates the great interest for entrepreneurship in Singapore alone. Beyond this, the trend for entrepreneurship investment in China, India, and Southeast Asia is also encouraging. Both from the input (number of graduates and family business) as well as from the demand (number of deals and capital invested by angel investors and Venture Capitalists along with the amount that governments invested as limited partners). \n\nThe importance of entrepreneurship, however, goes beyond job creation. It provides an ideal setting to train and equip individuals with skills they need for the future. While the future always seems uncertain, McKinsey, one of the leading management consultant firms in the world, has suggested that cognitive capability, interpersonal skills, and self-leadership are critical part of it. These are all skills that entrepreneurship is rather uniquely positioned to train."

        "description": "\"Knowledge management' and \"knowledge-based economy\" are buzz-words that now enjoy a wide currency. But what really is knowledge? Is it simply true belief? Or must the true belief also be justified? If knowledge involves justified true belief, what do belief, truth and justification amount to? Do we really know what we take ourselves as knowing? Or are the skeptics correct when they argue that we know nothing or almost nothing? Could we be brains in vats in a sunny laboratory, wired to a machine that feeds us the indistinguishable experience of watching the rain fall? How could we best respond to such skeptics? What are the sources of knowledge? How do perception, reflection, memory and prediction give us knowledge? Can we really ever know the shape of the future? How is knowledge acquired and transmitted?"

Qualitative methods help researchers develop insights into new phenomena, into process, and into complex relationships that are not easily ascertained with other methods. \n\nThe course will introduce qualitative methods from four perspectives. One is by formally studying and practicing the practices of the methods. The second is by studying formative qualitative pieces of research. The third is by understanding the strengths of qualitative research, in studying complex systems with interacting actors or subsystems, and in studying process. The fourth is by examining some of the techniques (as practiced in the real world) in contrast to how they might be practiced (or adapted) to other, specifically virtual, worlds."

This is not a course in statistical theory (i.e. we will not be deriving likelihood functions etc.) but a course on the practical use of statistical techniques to answer management related research questions. We will spend considerable time thinking about theoretical insights that can be translated into testable propositions, and how these propositions are best tested. We will do this through discussions of published papers from leading journals or high quality working papers in management research, and by having you solve statistical problems, work with data and estimate models. At the end of the course, you should be able to use common statistical methods to ask and answer research questions, and have developed critical skills in evaluating others’ research, such that you may apply these skills to your own thesis and other research works."

Does the media foster understanding, insight, and hold the powerful to account, or does it spread discord, misinformation, and maintain power hierarchies? These are the kinds of questions that students can find answers to in this project-based research design course. During the course students will learn how to write a rigorous empirical research paper and develop the methodological skills to survey public opinion and systematically code media content. After studying how to plan a content analysis and public opinion survey, students will work in groups and write a research proposal on a topic of their choosing. Potential topics are wide ranging. For instance, they could relate to elections, identity politics, migration, protest, conflict, as well as economic, business, environmental, health, or educational issues. Students then choose to design a survey or a content analysis. For the survey, students develop a questionnaire plan to gather public opinions on the media or preform a survey experiment to understand the impact of media. Students doing a content analysis will develop a codebook to code newspapers, TV, film, social media, or the web. After analyzing their unique data, student projects culminate in a presentation and an original research paper of approximately 9,000 words."

Importantly, teams are not only the work horses of organizations, but they are increasingly used to tackle the most important and strategic issues facing organizations.  Teams are charged with making important decisions, developing innovations, and solving complex problems. Thus, being able to develop and maintain high-performance teams is a crucial success factor for organizations. For individuals, their value to an organization depends to a large extend on how well they function as members and leaders of teams. Importantly team leadership is increasingly expected from all members of a team, rather than being tied to a specific official role; and team roles are becoming more and more fluid and situational. Moreover, organizations employ various types of teams, such as virtual teams, calling for increasing sophistication from their employees. The purpose of this course is to expose students to these issues and to make them familiar both with research and theory on teams as well as to increase their competency to work and lead in teams. Topics include team performance, team development, team innovation, team decision making, conflict in teams, and types of teams."

However, unlike most Western democracies, Japan maintained a mixture of democratic procedures, one-party dominance, alliance with U.S. military, high-level of economic growth, and social security from 1955 to 1993. Since to early 1993, many of mainstays of the previous system have collapsed and new institutions have established: coalition government, electoral reform, the bubble economy, etc. Following the experience of ‘Japanese miracle,’ the second half of the twentieth century has seen South Korea transformed from an impoverished, war-ravaged nation to one of the most successful economies in East Asian region. This has been accompanied by a political transformation from a military authoritarian regime to a vibrant democracy.

        "description": "Necessity is the mother of invention. One reason for firms to innovate is the necessity to re-invent themselves and get out of stagnation: the industry has either gotten obsolete, or competitors have adopted newer and more efficient business models, and products or services based on more advanced technologies. Innovation is then a necessity as the firm has to innovate or perish, one only has to look at what happened to Blockbuster and Kodak. Blockbuster at one point of time was the leading media rental firm in the world, but they chose to ignore innovation in the way they were delivering their media content to customers. As Netflix gained scale, Blockbuster’s inability to innovate meant that their business model was obsolete, and they had no choice but to file for bankruptcy. Kodak is another famous example: Steven Sasson at Kodak invented the digital camera way back in the 1970s, but rather than developing and commercializing the innovation, Kodak chose to put the new technology on the backburner, as its commercialization would have meant that their existing business model that relied on chemical printing of photographs would have to be cannibalized. However, other competitors jumped on the bandwagon for competitive advantage: hence, if you do not pursue innovation, your competitors will make you obsolete someday, no product or business model has an eternal shelf life. Innovation has many dimensions: it creates value for existing customers, thereby letting you keep your current market share; it creates value for new customers, enabling you to get growth; it enables you to work with new processes to access a lower cost base; supplier innovation enables you to leverage partners’ innovation capabilities to offer value to customers, and capture value for yourself. So the notion of continuous improvement is indeed extendable to continuous innovation, the business world in all sectors moves on a treadmill; the pace of the treadmill is faster in some industries like technology and fashion, and slower in some other industries. Innovation is the lever that enables you to keep pace on the treadmill if you are at the industry average; and enables you to set the pace if you innovate at a faster rate than the industry average. If you stand still on the treadmill or run at a slower pace than the treadmill in a competitive environment, at some stage, you will be thrown off the treadmill.\n\nThis course should be of particular interest to people aspiring for a career in designing and managing for innovation, either directly (e.g., V.P. of R&D, R&D Manager) or indirectly (e.g., management consulting). The course will also be useful to SME proprietors and entrepreneurs who intend to serve new markets, or use new technologies, or participants who wish to strategically reposition their offerings in an existing market. The course should also be of interest to people who manage interfaces between innovation and business functions such as finance, marketing, managerial accounting and human resources."

        "institution": "SMU",
        "description": "As a business professional, a firm understanding of employment law is crucial for driving business outcomes. At the minimum, this ensures that your legal obligations surrounding employees are always met. Yet, its importance extends far beyond legal compliance – employment law considerations are also vital in informing strategic management decisions across key areas, from workforce planning (e.g. cross-border recruitment, restructuring/downsizing), ESG performance (e.g. managing diversity and inclusion, workplace safety, grievances), risk management (e.g. protecting company assets, managing dispute resolution), stakeholder relations (e.g. managing unions), to expansion into new markets (e.g. navigating local laws).\n\nIn this regard, this course is designed to impart to you an understanding of the employment law regime in Singapore. You will acquire an awareness of the employment landscape and key employment-related laws in Singapore. You will learn to identify and address key issues that impact employment and affect employment relationships. You will develop a working understanding of the key ‘buckets’ of employment law, from hiring, managing, terminating, to post-termination matters. You will develop an appreciation of how these legal requirements not only apply to daily operational issues, but also how they form the crucial basis for higher-level strategic management decisions. You will hence study requirements and issues relating to the following non-exhaustive list of topics:\n\n• Hiring employees, including looking at fair hiring guidelines on non-discriminatory and ‘locals-first’ policies in Singapore; and hiring of foreign manpower;\n• Managing employees, including looking at employers’ and employees’ rights and obligations under law; employment contracts, including what they comprise and how they govern an employment relationship; and workplace safety and health matters, an area under significant scrutiny following COVID-19;\n• Terminating employees, including whether and how employees can be dismissed from the workplace; how retrenchment exercises work; and the respective pitfalls;\n• Industrial relations, including how they affect the hiring, managing and termination phases of the employment relationship; and\n• Post-termination concerns, including confidentiality and non-competition/solicitation obligations. \n\nThrough the course, you will be exposed to the different sources of employment law, including legislation, case law, tripartite guidelines, advisories issued by the Ministry of Manpower, amongst others. You will understand how the tripartite relationship between the Government, employers and unions work and affect these. In this respect, this is a very grounded course, which will require you to develop a clear understanding of the employment legal regime and then think practically on how to anticipate, manage, and navigate employment issues, as well as apply them to broader organizational objectives.\n\nThis course will be especially pertinent to students aspiring to careers as a HR professional or in management. In either role, a firm grasp of employment law means that you will be able to proactively identify and flag potential issues, hence becoming a valued strategic partner to your employer. The course will also be relevant to students who are interested in consulting work or business in general."

        "description": "Globalization is often associated with intensified cross-national flows of capital, commodities, and labor that elude state control and integrate local economies into global networks of production and trade.  This module examines the manifold dimensions of the global economy along three theoretical axes. First, the specific historical form of the global economy under study is “capitalism,” understood as not only an economic system of material production, distribution, and consumption but also a political order of power, authority, and legitimacy – in other words, a global political economy. Second, in analysing capitalism, we adopt a long historical view that traces the emergence of its fundamental logics and global expanse back to the eighteenth century. Third, we pay special attention to political and legal frameworks other than the nation-state, especially early-modern colonial empires, modern imperialism, and their institutional and ideological legacies that have endured into the post-war international regimes of production, trade, and development.\n\nThe aim is to provide a perspective on the political and historical dimensions of the global economy that is as multi-disciplinary as possible. Lectures and readings present material from international relations, economics, political science, history, sociology, anthropology, and geography. Although concepts and theories from economics and international political economy are central to this module, this is decidedly not a course in either international economics or the politics of economic relations among states. It is an investigation into a wider variety of forms and facets of politics as they pertain to the wide range of actors participating in the global economy."

Even more importantly, the course encourages you to think about and develop your own personal path to power (which can include, of course, a path away from power), as well as to develop your skills in exercising power and influence—to make you more comfortable with “managing with power.” The course will also introduce difficult ethical questions associated with the use of power and influence, and challenge you to define for yourself what constitutes the ethical exercise of power and influence in your life.\n\nThe materials and ideas that form the basis for much of the course have been selected because they challenge many aspects of conventional wisdom or the taken-for-granted assumptions that many people hold about the sources of success and influence. The ideas and concepts are, however, well grounded in empirical literature in the behavioral and social sciences. If some of the readings or discussions disagree with your ideas or cause you to feel uncomfortable, that discomfort is part and parcel of the learning process."

No professional entering the field can expect to succeed in his or her career without a solid understanding and hands-on practice of analytical tools to help in making people decisions.\n\nTo implement their business strategies effectively, leaders must deal with people issues in a way that allows them to gain competitive advantage through people. The organizations that will win the “war for talent” will be those which are better at identifying and keeping key talent, motivating high performance, developing and promoting staff and predicting future people needs accurately. HR professionals need analytics to address these challenges. For exam-ple, linking pay-for-performance has been a dogma of management, but recent research shows that most incentive plans do not produce the desired behavior, and that pay, in fact, has little correlation to business results.\n\nTo succeed in the business world, it is imperative that HR provide data-driven answers and insights on how to implement and execute strategy through the people in the organization. The course provides students with practi-cal, hands-on approaches to connect HR policies and practices to business performance. You will review key statis-tics and finance concepts, such as ROI and people productivity; become familiar with available tools such as Workday and Tableau to complement Excel and others; discuss data collection, clean-up and warehousing; prac-tice building descriptive and predictive models; and get hands-on experience in applications for workforce planning, recruitment, compensation, training, career planning and turnover.

The main theories, models and tools within the field of strategy will be covered with a strong emphasis in its application to real settings. We will use the tools that help top management analyze the business environment, formulate strategies and make decisions in competitive situations.\n\nThe course is divided in three parts.\n\nThe first part introduces tools to understand the industry structure and economics that determinate industry-wide profitability and are the base of every individual firm’s business strategy and resulting profitability, focusing on both resource/organizational and positional aspects.\nThe second part studies firm and industry dynamics, focusing on the changes in competition and the reaction of individual firms to the changes in their environment. We will use basic game theory as a tool to analyze competitive interactions when the number of players is small and the industry is being shaped by the interactions between those players. We will look at issues such as bargaining power, price competition, entry and exit decisions, standard setting and platform and technology based competition.\n\nIn the third part of the course we will work at the corporate and international strategy level and we will take a close look at the most fundamental issue in management. Why does one business meet its objectives, while another firm, apparently equally strong, fail? The goal of any firm is to develop a winning strategy and to build a successful organization. This is a tough job. So let us begin with the most obvious of facts: every organization is different. From this simple fact we can derive something quite useful for us as strategists: different firms in the same sector will have different strategies. A key reason is that the management teams evaluate differently the competitive environment and hence decide on different strategies but success does not depend solely on selecting a winning strategy: the achievement of results depends as well on the effectiveness of management. We must ask ourselves why one firm builds a strong, adaptive organization capable of creating and responding to competitive strategy, while a second firm patches together an organization that stumbles from initiative to initiative?"

While the most visible outcome of this course is a written opportunity report, we will also examine entrepreneurship from a managerial perspective, covering a wide area of issues that emerge with starting and growing new ventures\n– be they independent or corporate projects.\n\nThe 8 sessions that compose this course aim to give you a well-rounded learning experience, which will enable you to develop skills and apply tools vital in today’s business world, whether you explore it as an entrepreneur or a corporate manager. The theory you will receive from lectures and class readings will serve as a backbone to a range of hands-on experiences through case discussions, coaching sessions, teamwork, and so forth. By keeping the class experience on the interface between theory and practice, the course structure will lead you through the entrepreneurial process.\n\nThe cases, exercises, and projects will expose you to viewpoints on both sides of the table – that of the entrepreneur and that of the investor. Moreover, the settings in our case studies cover a range of industries and markets, from ventures backed by sophisticated investors to those funded by friends. By exposing you to a broad range of settings in which entrepreneurs  operate, the intent is to break the myth that entrepreneurship is limited to a few heroic figures covered in popular press, but if we so desire, accessible to all of us.\n\nThis entrepreneurship course is envisioned as a highly interactive class, where students learn from each other’s experiences through class discussion. In that sense, while I will do my best to provide you with interesting materials and facilitate discussion to highlight learning points, much of your learning depends on your preparation, participation, and contribution.\n\nUpon the completion of this course, participants should:\n\n- Know how to recognize and evaluate venture opportunities, understanding both the entrepreneur’s and the investor’s perspective;\n\n- Understand the issues faced by entrepreneurs when starting a venture, as well as acquire some of the fundamental skills and tools required for embarking on a new project in an independent and in a corporate context;\n\n- Understand the nature of opportunities in the context of new and/or growing ventures and be able to write a good opportunity report."

Typically, this transition calls for greater ability to manage and lead others toward larger organizational goals. Your success is no longer solely dependent on yourself but on others’ ability and willingness to work with you.\n\nThis course is designed to introduce fundamental aspects of what it means to manage and lead groups of people.  We will examine the key challenges that a young manager may face in contemporary organizations, focusing on topics such as influencing and motivating others, building effective teams, leading change, building creative organizations, and developing one’s own career path. We will take a global perspective but with an Asian emphasis to explore these challenges, drawing on real-world case studies from around Asia and beyond.\n\nThis course aims to provide you with a set of critical concepts and frameworks that would help you make the transition from an individual contributor to an organizational leader.  This set of concepts and frameworks would serve as a useful toolkit for you as you navigate the complex world of being an effective manager and leader."

        "description": "Talent is critical to the creation of organisational human capital.  We focus on talent activities including recruitment, selection, assessment, retention, and dismissal of employees.  In addition, we go beyond these core activities to evaluate the trade-offs of short-term and long-term strategies that improve organisational performance, morale, and diversity.  Areas such as employer branding, diversity, and work-life balance also are explored.\n\nWe will take an evidence-based and experiential approach to explore these talent management activities, reflecting and drawing on the recent evidence and on real-world case studies from around Asia and beyond. Readings (reflecting a selection of classics as well as cutting edge ideas) are assigned before each of the first four course sessions. The course will also consist of a business game in which one experiences first hand the short-term and long-term implications of strategic talent decisions on key deliverables such as productivity, morale, diversity, and turnover.\n\nTaken together, the concepts, frameworks, and approaches resulting from the readings and case studies together with the applied and experiential experience of the business game will provide you with key and invaluable leverage for resourcing and building a talent rich organisation."

We will problematize this view of the economy through a historical survey of Western social thought on central economic concepts and questions, such as property, exchange, labor, production, distribution, and consumption. This historical perspective reveals that economic problems are never purely economic but have always been entwined with political issues and ethical judgments. As we examine a range of social and political theories by situating them in their historical contexts, we will analyze how questions of power, authority, and legitimacy, and conceptions of good life have been central to various definitions of the economy. We will see that processes of production and consumption, and institutions of property and markets are invariably implicated in profound controversies about justice, fairness, freedom, and equality. Grappling with diverse approaches to the economy, some of which are wildly different than today’s dominant theories, is intended to cultivate a critical distance toward our tacit assumptions and broaden the scope of questions we can ask about prevailing economic structures and processes."

One of the highlights of this course will be a business game (last four sessions) in which you will experience first hand the short-term and long-term implications of your strategic talent decisions on key deliverables such as productivity, morale, diversity, and turnover. Each quarter, you and your team will be competing interactively against other teams and will be confronted with key talent incidents (related to talent recruitment, talent assessment, promotion, performance) and you will have to make the best decisions in line with your chosen talent strategy. The business game allows to apply the talent management concepts and approaches in a realistic, dynamic, and immersive environment, get instant feedback on the strategic decisions taken, and adapt talent management strategies along the way. \n\nTaken together, the concepts, frameworks, and approaches resulting from the readings, discussions, and case studies together with the applied experience from the business game will provide you with key and invaluable leverage for becoming effective in talent management."

Applications of design thinking to product and service innovation will be discussed, along with varying of the design contexts, including the private sector, government and social sectors. Participants learn to think like innovators, from the initial idea to managing resources, building partnerships with committed stakeholders and dealing with contingencies. In parallel, participants are encouraged to consider their individual accomplishments and how these might support new venture creation. Participants will work on past accomplishments, chartering the skills, knowledge and abilities that create a unique set of means with which to drive their own innovation projects."

Yet, for any change initiative to gain traction and develop into a major change, it first needs to be successfully implemented at the work unit. Hence, this course is designed to equip you with the science and art of leading and managing change from the grassroots. To this end, the course content is tailored to traverse three key elements of organizational change: 1) micro-processes (focused on the change agent), 2) meso-processes (focused on collective action), and 3) macro-processes (focused on the organizational and institutional environment). We unpack these key elements with an emphasis on the “how” of change – e.g., how do you speak up for yourself and others; how do you bring change proposals to life; how do you leverage resistance; how do you involve allies; how do you navigate mandated change?\n\nIn line with this focus on the “how” of change, we will draw on our experiences, case discussions, exercises, simulations, and practitioner-oriented literature to derive pragmatic insights on leading and managing change. Thus, analysis and discussion of your own and your classmates’ change initiatives are a central component to the course. In particular, given the importance of “learning by doing,” this course will be most valuable for students who are currently working on a change project or are about to undertake one."

However, the challenge faced by HC practitioners lies in knowing what to analyze and how to analyze.  Reports have revealed that only a small percentage of HC practitioners are proficient in undertaking advanced univariate analyses and that an even fewer number can perform advanced multivariate analyses.  This proficiency gap suggests a need for HC practitioners to be more competent in this field. The focus of this section of the course is to narrow this gap, allowing HC professionals to play a more strategic role within their organizations through equipping them with the ability to undertake some useful HC analytics on available organizational employee data.

The quality of judgments and decisions exerts a strong influence on the success of individuals, groups, and organizations. Given this, much of the research on decision making has compared normative models of decision making (how rational agents would make decisions) with how people and organizations actually make decisions (descriptive models). Further, given that judgments and decisions are made in all domains of human activity, research on JDM is very interdisciplinary. This will be reflected in the course readings, allowing you to get a broader perspective on the field. In this course, we will critically discuss some of the important research findings and methods of this literature. You will also develop your own research proposal."

And many organizational, leadership, and interpersonal dysfunctions can be attributed to weaknesses or failures in trust. Fortunately, over the last 25 years organizational scholars have built a large base of scientific knowledge on trust within organizations, comprising scores if not hundreds of double-blind peer-reviewed studies. Unfortunately, little of this research has been put into practice. This seminar aims to introduce students to the scientific research on trust, and then consider how that research can be extended and/or how the research and methods can be leveraged to address trust issues within organizations."

Design techniques have become a popular means of teaching people how to innovate, and especially so for the early stages of innovation. The techniques are ideal for not only problem solving but also for problem finding. The main components are as follow:\n\n• An introduction to the whole design thinking cycle via the Stanford “Wallet \n  exercise” (or the design of its equivalent), which roughly follows the \n  observation/ideate/prototype process. \n• An introduction to field research techniques (primarily, interviewing and \n  observational study).\n• Ideation techniques such as brainstorming, and its comparison with a few other \n  ideation techniques.\n• Rough or low fidelity (so-called) prototyping methods using simple materials to \n  achieve form and three-dimensionality, but without mechanical functionality. \n\nEach session is followed by a more academic discussion that discusses topics such as the strengths and weaknesses of various techniques. Students will also be exposed to the design studies tradition. \n\nPart 2: The second part of this course provides an overview of the innovation development process and the decisions that are made in the innovation development process. These decisions include:\n• the product definition (conceptualization and specifications to be included in the \n  product), the sharpness/fuzziness of the definition, the timing of the definition.\n• the design and formation of innovation teams, building trust between the different \n  partners, and the role of diversity, and\n• the management of risk in new product development, and the study of risk \n  management practices."

        "description": "Religion is not often analysed in conjunction with public policy. Policy involves the architecture of regulation – evoking rationality and secular bureaucracy. Religion, on the other hand, is rooted in ideology and ritual, and faith in things unseen. However, religion underpins not only most societies and cultures of Asia, but is also a key element in nation-state formation and identity. It wields formidable political clout. Furthermore, policy-making on religious matters is one of the most sensitive and contested areas of governance in contemporary Asia. In this course we will explore the rise and fall of the secularization thesis and the apparent rise of religiosity as a political force. We will closely examine and complicate the relationship between religion and the state, and we will explore ways in which religion impacts policy-making in seemingly ‘secular’ areas such as health-care, trade, and citizenship. We will examine the role of the state in managing religious diversity and multi-culturalism, touching also on its role in enforcing religious orthodoxy. Throughout this course we will seek to develop a nuanced and grounded understanding of the interplay between religion and policy in Asia."

Both ‘good’ innovation leadership and ‘good’ innovation governance are indispensable in order to determine the strategic goals of innovation efforts, to drive innovative thinking, creative processes and ideation, to structure and organise related work efforts so that things get done and to ensure a compelling innovation vision. While many organisations understand the need for innovation leadership and governance, the effectiveness of leadership for innovation - broadly speaking – varies greatly. Central to effective innovation leadership and governance are effective leaders with the right abilities who can match their competencies with the respective innovation situation they find themselves in. In this course, we will explore this challenge with the help of various theoretical frameworks and empirical studies to appreciate what it takes to avoid the classical traps of making innovation work in organisations in terms of strategy, process, structure, culture, skills and so forth. The course structure features alternating session units aimed at (i) internalising relevant concepts and frameworks as well as (ii) knowing how innovation practitioners lead and govern innovation efforts in real organisational contexts based on class discussions led by students and selected guests.\n\nBy the end of this course, students will be able to:\n\n• Appreciate the important role of leadership and governance in fostering innovation and creativity\n• Know what it takes to be an effective innovation leader   \n• Understand key innovation leadership principles and terms\n• Analyse and interpret existing empirical findings of innovation leadership studies\n• Apply key concepts, themes, and findings to various research paradigms and organisations"

The field of strategic management is concerned with understanding the sources of a firm’s comparative advantage (if any) as a prerequisite for understanding the firm’s performance. The field is distinct because of its focus on major business goals, the definition of a firm’s scope of business, the search for sustainable competitive advantage, and the adoption of a top management integrative perspective on a firm’s operations. \nBecause strategy is concerned with matching organizational resources with environmental opportunities, strategy research has naturally drawn on economics and organization theory as its two base disciplines. We are going to build on this evolution. We will try to cover the key theoretical foundations and areas of application in class and point to other important readings and applications as we go along."

All behaviour evolved through the process of natural selection. Traditional social science focuses on modelling human behaviour at the proximal level (e.g., a husband is more likely to hit his wife if he is jealous). While sometimes useful, such models can be considered micro-redescriptions rather than explanations of human behaviour. True explanations reference ultimate causation (why does jealousy exist?) and as such can at the same time lead to a profound understanding of who we are (revealing fundamental truths about human beings) as well as when and why we do what we do (thus improving on the traditional social science models predicting behaviour). The course will focus on key behaviours relevant to organisational life and the topics will also be partly customised around students’ interests."

Delivered through a combination of in-person lectures, short videos and practical case studies and examples, this module is meant to complement the work of organisations in line with sustainability performance or reporting conventions. The SDG Impact Standards collectively represent a decision-making (not a reporting) tool that help to actualise UN SDG-focused sustainability principles such as the Operating Principles for Impact Management (OPIM), United Nations Global Compact CFO Principles on Integrated SDG Investments and Social Value International’s (SVI) seven principles of social value. As such, the course will complement students learning across other MST modules, such as Sustainable Finance and Sustainability Reporting.\n\nThe SDG Impact casework, group project and industry engagement as part of this course will be coordinated and supervised and co-delivered by SMU and an industry expert.  The coursework will be divided into lecture, discussion/Q&A and group work/case study segments.

One of these focuses more on the role of industry characteristics and firm actions in the development of competitive advantage.  By contrast, the other stream tries to examine the influence of various organizational processes on the actions and decisions of a firm that a firm takes over time.  We shall examine the origins of this split and gain a better understanding of the distinctive characteristics of strategy process.\n\nWe will also cover some of the key areas of strategy process research.  In each of these, we will examine both conceptual and empirical papers that have contributed over time to our knowledge of the topic.  In discussing the papers on a particular topic, we will focus on the various theoretical frameworks and methodological approaches that have been used to investigate different questions.\n\nFor the most part, these topics have been arranged in historical order.  We begin with older areas of strategy process and gradually move to more recent topics.  Although we will deal with most of the significant process topics, the list is not designed to be exhaustive.  Strategy process represents a vast field, which is still growing.  This course should give you a basic overview of both the potential and the challenges of this distinctive perspective of strategy."

Sessions 1~5 will consist of a three or four-hour discussion during which a collection of article will be openly discussed and debated. The purpose of these sessions is to introduce conceptual material to fuel analysis and new conceptual developments. Session 6 will differ in that each student will present an idea for an original research project that is suggested by the week’s readings and discussions. Student will be given 20 minutes in total (15 mins for presentation; 5 mins for Q&A) for their Session 6 presentation. \n\nThe success depends on active student attention to the material at hand. Attempts to integrate the material with other courses and/or student projects are welcome. Through this and other courses students should develop an appreciation for the varied trajectories of strategic management research, and start to plot positions for themselves on those trajectories. \n\nThe class, to the extent possible, will be student directed. For some portion of each class, one student will take responsibility for preparing and facilitating the class discussion. During the seminars, students will be asked to place ideas and concepts within the domain of strategy, in an attempt to foster the development of competing and/or complementary perspectives across varied disciplines or varied strategy problems.\n\nThe ultimate objective is to help future strategy teachers understand, appreciate, and use concepts from the field in their educational and scholarly pursuits. In addition, the course will expose students to the nature of academic research and the social context of the field of strategy, and it will help prepare them for doing independent work."

This involves acquiring and organizing resources as well as partnering with suppliers in such a way that the targeted range of products and services are delivered to customers dependably in a costly and timely manner. A common challenge is the inflexible nature of supply and demand, which creates mismatches between the available supply and the customer demand. This leads to severe economic consequences on account of unsatisfied customers or wasted resources. To overcome this challenge and to maintain a competitive position, businesses need to constantly design and implement appropriate operational and supply chain capabilities.  In this course, we will study operations strategy, including manufacturing strategy and the resource based view of the firm, the management of global operations, the role of senior operations executives in the firm, contemporary research in operations strategy, followed by techniques that limit the incidence and consequence of supply-demand mismatches. Throughout the course, the focus will be on how to develop a competitive set of operations and supply chain capabilities. Using research articles and examples from a wide range of industries, we will illustrate that firms that employ these techniques and principles enjoy a significant competitive advantage."

        "description": "The purpose of this course is to help you better understand qualitative research methods so as to enable you to be a better researcher and reviewer of work that employs these types of methodologies. Given the breadth and variety of methods that fall under the rubric of “qualitative methods,” some classes will discuss general issues or skills that are applicable to several different methodological approaches (e.g., gaining access), while others will focus more specifically on a particular approach (e.g., ethnography).  You will notice that there is not a separate week on ethics.  Ethical treatment of those we study is crucial to all methodologies (quantitative and qualitative) – but ethical issues can be particularly acute in some forms of qualitative research.  As a result, we will integrate discussions of ethics throughout the course, and not relegate it to a weekly topic of discussion.\n\nQualitative methods courses in business schools are relatively rare. Ask most established qualitative researchers and they will talk about being trained using the apprenticeship model only. Taken together, this is both an exciting challenge and a daunting one – as there are few templates for such a course.  Consequently, your input will be essential in helping me refine and redesign the course as we go along. Thus, unlike other methods courses where you are “served” information, this course will be more like a “pot luck” with you bringing things to the class every week!\n\nThere will be at least two main avenues for learning in this class:\n\n1. Each week we will read and discuss what other researchers have written about a specific topic.  During the term, you will also do research on a specific methodology not covered in class. These will be the most “traditional” parts of class.\n\n2. There will be an “articles in the spotlight” each week. Selection of these articles was based on a variety of factors.  Many are award winning.  Most generally, I tried to pick articles that illustrate a specific methodological point (s) for a given week.  In addition to reading these articles for their theoretical content, we will discuss them in detail from a methodological standpoint. We will be addressing issues such as the following: “What makes this good (or bad) qualitative research?”  “What decisions did they have to make when deciding which information to include and which to leave out?”  “Was I convinced by the author’s (or authors’) arguments?”\n\nTo close, this course will be a lot of work -- but I also hope that it will also be enriching and fun!  By the time we are finished, you should have begun developing a unique skill set that should serve you well during graduate school and beyond."

Psychological interventions directly influence individual psychology to promote wellbeing or performance. Examples of psychological interventions include such techniques as reflecting on a challenge in a positive light, purposefully thinking about one’s capabilities as something that can be grown and developed, or reflecting on one’s important values to reaffirm the self.\n\nPsychological interventions can often be implemented cheaply and on a large scale, and they have already been successfully used in fostering positive change in several key domains of social life, including exercise and weight loss (Samuel‐Hodge et al., 2009), marital quality (Finkel, Slotter, Luchies, Walton, & Gross, 2013), and environmentally friendly behaviour (Goldstein, Cialdini, & Griskevicius, 2008). Yet, psychological interventions are underutilised in organisations, and future generations of organisational researchers have an opportunity to leverage this approach to promote positive change, from inducing a higher sense of meaning at work, to reducing stress experienced by marginalised groups, and aiding the adjustment of such employees.\n\nWe will review foundational social psychological work on psychological interventions and learn about key theoretical principles. These will then be applied to four broad areas of key importance to organisations, and corresponding to student interest: implicit theories, coping, social cohesion, and emotion regulation. In the final session, we consider the role of technology (big data and algorithms) in applying as well as exploiting psychological intervention strategies."

This course will enable you to use research methods in your chosen field of research, we have identified a set of premier faculty at SMU, who are all very well regarded in their respective fields for conducting this course. They also have a very wide range of interests, which will enable DBA candidates with different research interests to see a wide range of research methods in different fields. Topics that will be covered in this course include the formulation of the question to be investigated and the creation of resulting hypotheses, the collection of data and the analysis of the data collected, and the interpretation and study of analysis results. The methods of data collection and the analysis of data depend on the needs of the research question, these methods include but are not limited to one-on-one interviews, surveys and questionnaires, case study methods, and more involved econometric analyses, we will focus more on qualitative research methods in this course and less on involved econometric analyses."

Groupwork (teamwork), and, more broadly, collaboration among organizational members are fundamental to organizational success. Yet, team-level, and more broadly, meso-level organizational dynamics represent important and understudied topics in organizational research. Part of the challenge has been on complexity of meso-level phenomena, which introduces both theoretical and methodological challenges. The course aims to provide an overview of social psychological research on groups on the one hand, and organizational behavior research on teams on the other, and in that way identify theoretically rigorous and productive ways of studying groups in organizations. The course further emphasizes discussion of existing projects on teams (by more senior students) and development of new ideas to refine team-level theorizing and study design skills."

        "description": "Research methods in different fields of research in business are diverse in terms of focus, methods used, and analysis, based on the ways that fields have evolved, and the data that can be collected with those methods. However, there are some common underlying themes of research methods across areas, that can be ported across different streams of literature to enable researchers to learn from diverse streams of research. In this course, we will take a deep dive into the research methods used in areas as diverse as Operations Management, Strategy, Economics, OBHR, Accounting and Finance.\n\nResearch methods usually vary by the richness of the literature in the desired field of study, Exploratory research is typically conducted at the beginning of the evolution of a field, when the questions associated with a topic are not well understood, studies in this phase are largely driven by observations in the industry, and an understanding of common practices, coupled with theoretical arguments of what constitutes good practice. Gradually, an established theory evolves that becomes the dominant theory to explain the topic, after that, the research on the topic moves to the descriptive phase, in which the research methods used are more detailed, causal effects can be established, and the data gathering and analysis processes are based more on involved econometric analyses. In this course, we will look largely at exploratory research methods used in the areas of as Operations Management, Strategy, Economics, OBHR, Accounting and Finance, as exploratory early stage research typically leads to a higher impact."

Most people tend to spend a large part of their waking hours working / at work. As a consequence, work is more than a source of income but also is an important source and determinant of our wellbeing. Traditional theories have emphasized how work can contribute to human suffering, for example, through as alienation, stress, harassment, discrimination, and burnout. But work can also be a source of human flourishing. This aspect has been gaining more attention through developments such as scholarship on positive organizational scholarship, positive psychology, and mindfulness at work. In this course, we will critically discuss some of the important theoretical approaches, methods, and empirical findings on flourishing at work. In parallel, to gain first-hand experience, we will also try out for ourselves some of the practices and interventions that have been proposed, studied, and validated in this research."

Consequently, leisure is often relegated as \"time off work\" and sometimes leads people to construe work and leisure as opposites. This promotes the pursuit of passive and convenient leisure in contrast to their more goal-directed and effortful work activities. Unfortunately, research shows that passive leisure is not restorative nor provides important ingredients to meaningful living. In this course, we examine people’s motivation to work and its reciprocal relationship with their pursuit of leisure. It aims to help students apply to their daily lives what the psychological literature advocates about quality leisure activities and living a \"good\" life, which will also help them flourish at work."

Without shipping, intercontinental trade, the bulk transport of raw materials, and the import/export of affordable food and manufactured goods would simply not be possible.  In fact, the standard container boxes are the bits and bytes that flow in today’s international trade network. Shipping logistics catalyzes the international supply chain management which deals with the management of physical goods (raw materials, components, finished products), information (orders, status, contracts), and financial flows (payment, credits, etc.) in a network of suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and customers. \n\nThis course examines the strategic role of shipping in global supply chains, and is an elective course which combines lectures, readings from the latest industry news, and case discussions. It exposes students to some real-industry managerial and business issues, useful conceptual frameworks, and practical analytical/quantitative models to equip them with the strategic logistics skills and the handles necessary to understand current developments in the logistics management of international shipping, as well as in the broader context of global supply chain management."

Many companies have started doing so by integrating sustainability into their operations. A focus on reducing environmental impact not only allows these companies to comply with increased regulations but also to reduce their costs, to improve the quality of their products, and to enhance the reputation of their brands. In addition, a new brand of companies is going beyond simply reducing negative externalities and actively tries to create a positive impact on the world.\n\nIn this course, students will learn how citizens, governments, customers, and employees are creating pressures for more sustainable development and how operations managers are responding to these pressures with principles and frameworks such as waste reduction, pollution prevention, and product stewardship. Through the course, students will study specific tools and concepts such as life cycle assessment (LCA), design for environment (DfE), take-back legislation, green manufacturing, green purchasing, remanufacturing, recycling and by-product synergy.  Students will also learn how to create a successful strategy for sustainable operations by incorporating sustainability considerations into business strategy, improvement planning, product and process design, supply management and risk management."

As global trade is dependent on global supply chain, companies make investment decisions to globalize, setting up production facilities overseas and sales offices beyond their domestic market. The key aspects for companies embarking on global Supply Chain involves cross-border sourcing, overseas production, global planning and international distribution, where the various components for a final product could be sourced from different parts of the world, and manufactured at one or multiple locations and have them distributed to different markets.\n\nManaging a global supply chain is also no longer about driving down cost, but it is how companies can maintain their competitiveness and global supply chains has never been more challenging and disruptive in the current environment of pandemic and geo-political tensions. In addition, e-commerce has also changed the design for global supply chain as well. This course provides students with a practical lens and frameworks regarding global supply chain. Students learn the key concepts on global supply chain management, together with special topics on maritime logistics, technology and green supply chain that affects the development of global supply chain. Understanding them would enable the students to better appreciate the complexities when handling global supply chain activities in future.\n\nTopics covered include: considerations for global sourcing, selection criteria for global production locations, planning in an uncertainty, volatility, complexity and ambiguity environment, various international methods of entry to overseas market, e-commerce distribution, incoterms and different modes of transportation, terms of payment, customs requirements, and maritime distribution network. Business cases and real-life examples will be used in the course. Industry speakers will be invited as guest lecturers to share the challenges and practical solutions relating to global supply chain. This course is highly relevant for the current business environment and is recommended for those interested in working for global companies managing cross-border business."

Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss from operation failure.  Compared to other types of risk, such as credit, underwriting, and innovation risk, operational risk is perhaps the most fundamental and significant one. Why? Operational risk is highly asymmetrical in nature, because of the potential for very large losses due to extreme events (though these are usually few in number). Precisely because extreme events are so rare relative to other risk types, they are very difficult to assess. For organizations motivated by profit, a net positive return is required by shareholders. Operational risk therefore is a key concern of both internal and external stakeholders. \n\nThe course will give students an overview of which operational risks are prevalent in various industries and what tools and techniques can be used to identify, quantify and control operational risks. Besides learning the basics of probability and statistical theories, students will become familiar with the risk analysis framework and will conduct a risk analysis using either Oracle’s Crystal Ball software or @Risk from Palisade.

        "description": "Broadly speaking, this course is about developing an understanding of what exactly supply chains do, and how they function. More importantly, our particular focus will be on uncovering hidden sources of value in supply chains, and how such value creation enables new companies to quickly grow and dominate their markets.  Companies like Wal-mart, Dell, Zara, and Li & Fung are first and foremost, as their own executives frequently mention in the media, in the supply chain business. Recognizing untapped business opportunities has allowed those companies not just to develop very fast and become industry leaders, but also to set new industry standards and benchmarks when it comes to supply chain management. Closer to home, we’ll discuss how one Singapore company went from zero to $500M in revenues in just five years, based on a single idea on how to improve supply chain efficiency.\n\nThis course will introduce and utilize key tactics such as risk pooling and inventory placement, such as integrated planning and collaboration. It will delve into powerful supply chain levers such as incentives and information sharing.  Particular course objectives include:\n\n1.\tIdentify key supply chain issues and challenges\n2.\tUnderstand the role of uncertainty and risk in supply chains\n3.\tLearn about different tools to manage risk\n4.\tBecome familiar with differing incentives in supply chains\n5.\tDevelop an understanding of alternative incentive structures \n6.\tKnow about the function of inventory in supply chains\n7.\tAppreciate different strategies used by companies to improve supply chain performance"

        "description": "Since the seminal work of Fisher Black, Myron Scholes and Robert Merton in the early seventies, an elegant theory has been developed for efficient derivatives securities valuation. The concepts of arbitrage, martingales and numerical methods are the three pillars on which the theory and implementation of the valuation of derivative securities rests. Today, advanced financial modelling techniques, developed by collaboration between academics and practitioners, have fundamentally transformed the financial market landscape. The derivatives business alone is a multi-trillion-dollar market. The objective of this course is to provide students a first course in financial calculus and the modelling of financial derivatives.\n\nAlthough the main emphasis of this course is on models based on stochastic processes, we start with binomial trees to illustrate 3 key concepts: hedging, no-arbitrage, and risk-neutrality. This lays down the foundation for more advanced topics, including martingales, stochastic integrals, stochastic differential equations, Ito’s formula, change of measure etc. The insight that created this subject and led to the development of the field of financial derivatives is the pricing and hedging of vanilla European options. There are two main approaches – 1) stochastic calculus with partial differential equation and 2) probability theory with martingale pricing formula. Both will be covered in this course. The same framework has subsequently been applied to the pricing and hedging of other more exotic financial products. Regardless of the approach taken, the theory is based on the assumption on no-arbitrage, and hence strong emphasis is placed on the importance of hedging and dynamic replication.\n\nThis course is an interesting mix of finance and mathematics. Students will see that simple financial concepts like the no-arbitrage principle, coupled with careful mathematical reasoning, can lead to a sophisticated formulation of pricing and hedging framework. Students are encouraged to form a rigorous understanding of financial modelling, valuation techniques and hedging."

Appropriate research methods allow us to rigorously investigate and develop evidence to address important problems. This section of the course is an introductory master-level seminar on empirical research methods in the context of business research.

It is meant to help students make informed choices about designing and conducting their own research studies effectively and ethically.\n\nHC analytics focuses on the use of people data for HC decisions and it involves mapping HC initiatives to business outcomes.  The key benefits of employing HC analytics include quantifying returns on HC investments and optimizing employee investments to achieve tangible business outcomes. However, the challenge faced by HC practitioners lies in knowing what to analyze and how to analyze.  Reports have revealed that only a small percentage of HC practitioners are proficient in undertaking advanced univariate analyses and that an even fewer number can perform advanced multivariate analyses.  This proficiency gap suggests a need for HC practitioners to be more competent in this field. The focus of this section of the course is to narrow this gap, allowing HC professionals to play a more strategic role within their organizations through equipping them with the ability to undertake some useful HC analytics on available organizational employee data. The course will use the SPSS software package, chosen for its ease of use and commercial accessibility."

Given the focus on the MSc program, the course will be taught with a quantitative bent. However, the overarching aim is to equip students with the key tools and a broad awareness of the key issues in the industry. It is targeted at students with a keen interest to join the asset management industry as a quantitative analyst or portfolio manager. The course will first look at the theoretical aspects of modern portfolio theory. Following that risk premia strategies at both the top-down asset class level and the bottom-up security selection level will be explored. Finally we examine alternative portfolio construction methods aiming to mitigate the shortfalls inherent in portfolios constructed by the classic mean-variance optimization approach. The course attempts to blend a combination of technical rigor, real life practice as well as insights from academic research. Some numerical implementation using software packages such as MATLAB, R or Python may be involved during project work. The course delivery is intended to be interactive with active student engagement to foster a learning environment that facilitates creative thinking in the process of peer learning."

        "description": "A supply chain comprises firms, organizations, and individuals, linked through physical (material), information and financial flows, and whose activities enable products and services to be created and reach the consumers. In the last few decades, supply chain managers have reoriented their focus beyond the traditional logistics issues towards the development of integrated risk management approaches to handle the multiplicity and magnitude of risk factors in global supply chains. These risk factors include disruptions arising from natural and man-made disasters, technological innovations, fast-changing customer preferences, tight financial credit environments and fluctuating exchange rates and commodity prices. Building a functional supply chain requires careful planning and consideration of a variety of risks, and it is of paramount importance to integrate management of physical flows, information and financial flows in dealing with such risks. All logistics and supply chain organizations that effectively manage their supply chain risks enjoy a level of robustness and resilience that leads to unprecedented levels of operational excellence with all consequential advantages. The objective of this course is to provide a framework for supply chain risk management and to outline a portfolio of proven strategies to access, reduce, hedge, and mitigate supply chain risks."

The size of financial data has experienced exponential growth. With computational resources becoming cheaper, these data can be analyzed in full to hunt for hidden patterns or relationships previously undetectable. In recent years, there is a growing need for data specialist with a strong background in financial and quantitative modelling to accelerate digital transformation in both the Singapore and global financial markets.\n\nUnlike most other big datasets, financial data is widely known to be extremely noisy with a weak signal-to-noise ratio. Many patterns uncovered are due purely to randomness. With the availability of advanced machine learning algorithms, financial data scientists with a deep knowledge of financial data properties are in demand. There is a surge of interest in exploring the application of machine learning to financial problem. For example, in 2019 JP Morgan assessed the feasibility of using AI for option pricing, while Hull (2020) explored using reinforcement learning to self-discover the dynamic delta hedging strategy for option pricing. UBS created Evidence Lab focusing in financial data science in 2017.

        "institution": "SMU",
        "description": "Necessity is the mother of invention. One reason for firms to innovate is the necessity to re-invent themselves and get out of stagnation: the industry has either gotten obsolete, or competitors have adopted newer and more efficient business models, and products or services based on more advanced technologies. Innovation is then a necessity as the firm has to innovate or perish, one only has to look at what happened to Blockbuster and Kodak. Blockbuster at one point of time was the leading media rental firm in the world, but they chose to ignore innovation in the way they were delivering their media content to customers. As Netflix gained scale, Blockbuster’s inability to innovate meant that their business model was obsolete, and they had no choice but to file for bankruptcy. Kodak is another famous example: Steven Sasson at Kodak invented the digital camera way back in the 1970s, but rather than developing and commercializing the innovation, Kodak chose to put the new technology on the backburner, as its commercialization would have meant that their existing business model that relied on chemical printing of photographs would have to be cannibalized. However, other competitors jumped on the bandwagon for competitive advantage: hence, if you do not pursue innovation, your competitors will make you obsolete someday, no product or business model has an eternal shelf life. Innovation has many dimensions: it creates value for existing customers, thereby letting you keep your current market share; it creates value for new customers, enabling you to get growth; it enables you to work with new processes to access a lower cost base; supplier innovation enables you to leverage partners’ innovation capabilities to offer value to customers, and capture value for yourself. So the notion of continuous improvement is indeed extendable to continuous innovation, the business world in all sectors moves on a treadmill; the pace of the treadmill is faster in some industries like technology and fashion, and slower in some other industries. Innovation is the lever that enables you to keep pace on the treadmill if you are at the industry average; and enables you to set the pace if you innovate at a faster rate than the industry average. If you stand still on the treadmill or run at a slower pace than the treadmill in a competitive environment, at some stage, you will be thrown off the treadmill.\nThis course should be of particular interest to people aspiring for a career in designing and managing for innovation, either directly (e.g., V.P. of R&D, R&D Manager) or indirectly (e.g., management consulting). The course will also be useful to SME proprietors and entrepreneurs who intend to serve new markets, or use new technologies, or participants who wish to strategically reposition their offerings in an existing market. The course should also be of interest to people who manage interfaces between innovation and business functions such as finance, marketing, managerial accounting and human resources."

These are possibilities that offer more independence and opportunities to pursue your passion, while solving problems in firms and society and creating sparks that will inspire others.\n\nIf you feel hesitant, you are not alone. Studies show that many individuals are unsure about being an entrepreneur. Not for fear of failure. Rather, for the lack of the necessary skills and knowledge, preventing them from being able to identify, evaluate, and pursue good entrepreneurial opportunities (Gomulya et al., 2015).  You don’t have to start a company tomorrow. However, having basic entrepreneurial skills goes a long way should your personal goals and circumstances ever change. These days, an entrepreneurial mindset is already becoming a necessity rather than an option, both in start-ups and established firms. Why not seize the opportunity to learn now?\n\nThis course aims to help you instil and apply an entrepreneurial mindset in the context of business planning. We will achieve this through a number of ways including: generation of business ideas, and identification of business opportunities to commercialize the ideas. This course covers some ongoing management challenges for entrepreneurial ventures and integrates inter-disciplinary knowledge customized by your personal experiences and goals. By combining problem-based learning and hands-on pedagogical approaches, this course encourages creativity and the integration of course readings, real life cases, and student-driven business plans, situated in interactive class and group discussions."

        "description": "Digital technologies have virtually disrupted every industry and caused permanent changes to the way we work and live. Although many businesses have benefited from the new technology, more of them are being threatened or have been displaced by it. From now, digital technology will only proliferate at an exponential rate and businesses who cannot harness such capabilities will experience an accelerated erosion of their competitive advantages in productivity, product and service offerings, staff quality, consumer loyalty, and many other areas. Despite the urgent need for digital transformation, many businesses have slid into what Gartner documented as the “Trough of Disillusionment”. Many explanatory factors were offered and most centred around the confusion of what digital transformation actually entails.\n\nWe define digital transformation as a movement centred around a digital-first thinking, as opposed to the misconceived technology-first or digital improvement approaches. A digital-first approach starts with a thorough understanding of the new paradigms of business strategy made possible by digital technologies, followed by a working understanding of the technologies involved, and most importantly, the organizational structure, teamwork, and culture that are necessary to support such endeavours. Digital transformation is not a patchwork of modular improvements designed for plug-and-play. It is a top-down, holistic, enlightened, determined, and dynamic (agile) movement aimed at persisting business performance.\n\nIn this course, students will be given the opportunity to master digital-first thinking via our three prong approach. We start with the inculcation of new digital drivers of disruptive businesses through frameworks, toolkits, and discussions. Following which, we introduce the essential building blocks of digital-first thinking to transform business value propositions, improve decision making, optimize organizational structures and processes, and create a new working culture that is needed for a digital-first organisation. In the third part, we will attempt to synergize what we have learned and collectively create strategies and roadmaps for existing and new industries of the future."

We will delve into different types of analytics like descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics, different types of data, structured and unstructured, and different types of analysis and tools. As such, we will use developments in statistical science to examine solutions to important issues faced in business analytics. There will be various cases and readings provided and used in the class to demonstrate the importance of data-driven decision making. Specifically, we will discuss regression, measuring online impact, machine learning techniques, conducting field experiments, and innovation in retail and digital analytics. The main emphasis of this course is on understanding, interpreting and proper use of various research techniques and providing executives with important quantitative acumen for appreciating business analytics."

Yet, although people negotiate all the time, most know very little about the strategy and psychology of effective negotiations. Why do we sometimes get our way whereas other times we walk away feeling frustrated by our inability to obtain the agreement we desire?\n\nNegotiation is the art and science of securing agreements between two or more interdependent parties. This course is designed to be relevant to a broad spectrum of negotiation problems that are faced by managers and professionals. It is also designed to complement the technical and diagnostic skills that are learned in other courses at the SMU. A basic premise of this course is that while managers need analytical skills to develop optimal solutions to problems, they also require a broad array of negotiation skills for these solutions to be accepted and implemented. Successful completion of this course will enable you to recognize, understand, and analyse essential concepts in negotiations."

Given the breadth and variety of methods that fall under the rubric of “qualitative methods,” all classes will discuss general issues or skills that are applicable to several different methodological approaches.  You will notice that there is not a separate week on ethics.  Ethical treatment of those we study is crucial to all methodologies (quantitative and qualitative) – but ethical issues can be particularly acute in some forms of qualitative research.  As a result, we will integrate discussions of ethics throughout the course, and not relegate it to a weekly topic of discussion.\n\nQualitative methods courses in business schools are relatively rare. Ask most users of qualitative methods and they will talk about being trained using the apprenticeship model only. Taken together, this is both an exciting challenge and a daunting one – as there are few templates for such a course.  Consequently, your input will be essential in helping me refine and redesign the course as we go along. Thus, unlike other methods courses where you are “served” information, this course will be more like a “pot luck” with you bringing things to the class every week!\n\nThere will be many avenues for learning in this class: Each week we will read and discuss what academic scholars and researchers have written about a specific topic.  During the course, you will also do research on a specific methodology not covered in class. These will be the most “traditional” parts of class. Furthermore, in this course, I will give you a “hands on” experience and the opportunity to explore and experiment with some of the data collection and data analyses strategies.\n\nTo close, this course will be a lot of work -- but I also hope that it will also be enriching and fun!  By the time we are finished, you should have begun developing a unique skill set that should serve you well at work."

        "institution": "SMU",
        "description": "Necessity is the mother of invention. One reason for firms to innovate is the necessity to re-invent themselves and get out of stagnation: the industry has either gotten obsolete, or competitors have adopted newer and more efficient business models, and products or services based on more advanced technologies. Innovation is then a necessity as the firm has to innovate or perish, one only has to look at what happened to Blockbuster and Kodak. Blockbuster at one point of time was the leading media rental firm in the world, but they chose to ignore innovation in the way they were delivering their media content to customers. As Netflix gained scale, Blockbuster’s inability to innovate meant that their business model was obsolete, and they had no choice but to file for bankruptcy. Kodak is another famous example: Steven Sasson at Kodak invented the digital camera way back in the 1970s, but rather than developing and commercializing the innovation, Kodak chose to put the new technology on the backburner, as its commercialization would have meant that their existing business model that relied on chemical printing of photographs would have to be cannibalized. However, other competitors jumped on the bandwagon for competitive advantage: hence, if you do not pursue innovation, your competitors will make you obsolete someday, no product or business model has an eternal shelf life. Innovation has many dimensions: it creates value for existing customers, thereby letting you keep your current market share; it creates value for new customers, enabling you to get growth; it enables you to work with new processes to access a lower cost base; supplier innovation enables you to leverage partners’ innovation capabilities to offer value to customers, and capture value for yourself. So the notion of continuous improvement is indeed extendable to continuous innovation, the business world in all sectors moves on a treadmill; the pace of the treadmill is faster in some industries like technology and fashion, and slower in some other industries. Innovation is the lever that enables you to keep pace on the treadmill if you are at the industry average; and enables you to set the pace if you innovate at a faster rate than the industry average. If you stand still on the treadmill or run at a slower pace than the treadmill in a competitive environment, at some stage, you will be thrown off the treadmill.\n\nThis course should be of particular interest to people aspiring for a career in designing and managing for innovation, either directly (e.g., V.P. of R&D, R&D Manager) or indirectly (e.g., management consulting). The course will also be useful to SME proprietors and entrepreneurs who intend to serve new markets, or use new technologies, or participants who wish to strategically reposition their offerings in an existing market. The course should also be of interest to people who manage interfaces between innovation and business functions such as finance, marketing, managerial accounting and human resources. This course introduces the student to ‘the front end of innovation’. We will explore the practice of innovation, and we will also apply the techniques and principles of innovation that will step through the ideation and opportunity recognition ‘front end’ of innovation. The tools that support it are a powerful process that can improve product, service and experience concepts (selected applications to products and services will be covered). The course will cover theories of innovation management and how to make organizations more innovative. We will introduce participants to the concept of Creativity being the front end of innovation. The theoretical background that we will use for Creativity will be the Innovator’s Method Model by Furr and Dyer, the Innovator’s DNA model created by Dyer, Gregersen and  Christensen, and the ideas of creativity enhancement challenges by IDEO and taught by the Stanford Design School. We will first elicit definitions of creativity and innovation from the participants, followed by a number of interactive exercises for enhancing creativity that were designed by IDEO. Overall, we will have interactive exercises and tools for most of the sessions, all the creativity challenges are tools for enhancing creativity, as shown by the Stanford Design School. They key message will be the correspondence between creativity and divergent thinking. We will show that the creativity aspect of individuals in hindered by various cognitive biases, we will define and explore these biases.\n\nManaging innovation and growth is challenging, as innovation can be driven by multiple facets. Business innovation can be classified into three kinds: (i) innovation of the core products and services that are offered to customers, called product or service innovation. This is the most commonly understood kind of innovation, the firm can either create improved variants of existing products and services, giving them a competitive advantage in the current industry scenario; or it can create radically new products and services that create new markets. The Apple iMac comes out with new variants all the time that are faster and lighter, this would be an example of an innovation that gives you a competitive advantage in an existing market. The iPad created a new market, in that it was somewhere between a mobile phone and a laptop, the phablet would be an example of a product that created a new market. (ii) innovations in the design of the supply chain enable the firm to lower its cost base, leverage the innovative capabilities of its suppliers, and get its products and services to your customers faster and at lower cost. Toyota’s well-known Keiretsu model is a good example of process or supply chain innovation, that lowers the cost of delivery, and improves service levels simultaneously. Finally, (iii) innovations at the interface of the firm with their suppliers and consumers enables customers to provide more value to their customers, and capture more value for themselves, by matching supply and demand better. Zara’s famed agile model, where they design and produce small batches to understand customer preferences and then scale production of bestsellers has enabled them to get a significant market and cost advantage, Zara is the world’s biggest apparel seller today. This course has a large emphasis on hands-on learning, using simulations and classroom exercises to give the participant a better idea of advancements in innovations and growth. The course gives the participant an overview of the issues of innovation and growth management in a wide variety of industries, including digital businesses.  After completing the course, the student should be able to characterize the innovation and growth issues in an industry/firm, evaluate current practice and identify improvement opportunities for making innovation sustainable using resources on a global scale."

This course is your opportunity to learn to apply creative and collaborative tools, such as brainstorming and prototypes, to real-life challenges. As we discuss design thinking case studies at many Fortune 500 companies, you will be first introduced (in the form of interactive lectures) then practice (through hands-on workshops) the design thinking process. Designs go through many iterations and you will also refine your project multiple times. By staying human-centered, you too can learn to communicate with creative confidence knowing that while your solution may not be perfect, it optimally meets the needs of the people you are designing for."

        "institution": "SMU",
        "description": "The 48 countries and 3 territories that comprise Asia are each individually and comparatively highly distinct and diverse from each other – more so than any other broad region of the world. While founded as civilisations, the subsequent influences of transcontinental trade carried with it a diversity of cultures, languages, religions, colonialism, industrialisation, nation-state conceptualisations, inter-regional and global wars, state revolutions, and alternative forms of capitalisms - thereby creating a kaleidoscope of markets for businesses to navigate in the region. Japan, China, and India represent the historical nexus in Asia, each having their own challenges for foreign businesses to penetrate. But what has been gaining the attention of business has been the emergence of the ASEAN region – an opportunity represented by over 600 million people, a population greater than Europe, which will become the fourth largest economy in the world by 2030. Comprising Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar, Malaysia, Cambodia, Laos, Singapore, and Brunei (ordered by population size), ASEAN is the fourth largest export trading region in the world. However, economic development across ASEAN is extremely diverse with the spread of per capita income being a factor 24x between the richest country, Singapore, versus the poorest, Cambodia.\n\nThis course will equip the student with an appreciation of the historical influences on the social-political-economic structures of the countries within Asia, with an emphasis on ASEAN. Similar to the analogy that it is better for sustained survival to teach someone how to fish rather than give them fish, this course will provide students with the tools to understand how to internationalise within Asia. Students will learn to conceptualise the different forms of capitalisms that are practiced across these markets, identifying implications for the business model of the multinational. As a manager of a multinational, or a local family business beginning to expand beyond the home market to become a multinational, the student will also learn about the role of, and interrelations, among the corporate headquarters, regional office, and foreign country subsidiaries, as they attempt to penetrate the markets within their selected foreign countries, and manage the enterprise."

The content of this course is based on cutting-edge research in both academic and practitioner communities. The course provides students with an opportunity to analyze real-world business problems.\n\nThe best way to learn all the material in this course is through “hands-on” experience. As such, we will use recent developments in statistical science to examine solutions to important issues faced in business research. There will be various datasets and tools provided and used in the class to get practical experience about Business Analytics. Specifically, we will discuss different types of analytics, basic statistics, market and segmentation techniques, regression and classification modeling, machine learning techniques, and digital analytics. The emphasis being on understanding, interpretation and proper use of various business research techniques. One of the goals of this course is to train knowledgeable managers who can evaluate the quality of the research and utilize the information to effectively make strategic decisions.

Students will engage with the need for deeper research, better audience analysis, and more structured writing, with a more nuanced adaptation to the context appropriate to their intended publications.\n\nStudents will consider and respond to meaningful real-world issues and situations in each of the three written projects. They will explore not only what other people have said about the issues that they confront, but also develop and communicate their own responses. The finished pieces will form the basis of a portfolio of written work to showcase their ability to think critically, conduct appropriate literature research, analyse their findings, argue their case, and produce professional communication outcomes. This portfolio will be a valuable addition to their resumes when they graduate.\n\nThe final project will be an in-depth feature piece written for either Rice Media (https://www.ricemedia.co/) or the Skeptic Magazine (https://www.skeptic.org.uk/).\n\nRice Media, and Skeptic Magazine editors advise the students during the Week 10 presentations, and students will have the chance to have their work published by the media outlet that they write for after the term finishes."

In 2008, for the first time, more people lived in urban areas than rural areas. In 1950, 30 per cent of the world’s population was urban, and by 2050, 66 per cent of the world’s population is projected to be urban (based on the forecast of 9 billion people). In this scenario, the UN projects that humans will consolidate into 41 megacity regions by 2030.\n\n• Indeed, these challenges create a multitude of opportunities for business who have the chance to offer innovative solutions for our future. Of course, the complexity of the problem calls for a systemic approach based on new technologies, new business models, new approaches to planning, financing and policy making.\n\n• This module will address the topic of the future of cities by focusing on forecasts, experts’ opinions, case studies and industry insights.\n\n• Since this module is a Glocal Elective, the topics will be discussed from a global perspective.\n\n• The application, execution and transformation of ‘smart cities’ will focus on Singapore as a global best practice exemplar."

        "institution": "SMU",
        "description": "The 48 countries and 3 territories that comprise Asia are each individually and comparatively highly distinct and diverse from each other – more so than any other broad region of the world. While founded as civilisations, the subsequent influences of transcontinental trade carried with it a diversity of cultures, languages, religions, colonialism, industrialisation, nation-state conceptualisations, inter-regional and global wars, state revolutions, and alternative forms of capitalisms - thereby creating a kaleidoscope of markets for businesses to navigate in the region. Japan, China, and India represent the historical nexus in Asia, each having their own challenges for foreign businesses to penetrate. But what has been gaining the attention of business has been the emergence of the ASEAN region – an opportunity represented by over 600 million people, a population greater than Europe, which will become the fourth largest economy in the world by 2030. Comprising Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar, Malaysia, Cambodia, Laos, Singapore, and Brunei (ordered by population size), ASEAN is the fourth largest export trading region in the world. However, economic development across ASEAN is extremely diverse with the spread of per capita income being a factor 24x between the richest country, Singapore, versus the poorest, Cambodia.\n\nThis course will equip the student with an appreciation of the historical influences on the social-political-economic structures of the countries within Asia, with an emphasis on ASEAN. Similar to the analogy that it is better for sustained survival to teach someone how to fish rather than give them fish, this course will provide students with the tools to understand how to internationalise within Asia. Students will learn to conceptualise the different forms of capitalisms that are practiced across these markets, identifying implications for the business model of the multinational. As a manager of a multinational, or a local family business beginning to expand beyond the home market to become a multinational, the student will also learn about the role of, and interrelations, among the corporate headquarters, regional office, and foreign country subsidiaries, as they attempt to penetrate the markets within their selected foreign countries, and manage the enterprise."

        "description": "Family firms are ubiquitous in many economies. Half of the 30 largest firms in 27 developed economies are family-owned. In the S&P 500, 40% are family firms. In the Asia Pacific, family firms are estimated to comprise 85% of commercial businesses.\n\nSince family owners usually have long-standing ties with local communities, family firms are also strong proponents of community impact and local causes. As wealth owners, family members also have the potential to deploy private capital in commercial investments, as well as towards broader causes in the philanthropic and impact space. Business families thus play a critical role in the sustainability agenda through their operating businesses as well as in their private capacity.\n\nFamily firms differ from the typical MNC in terms of their links to the family’s legacy, values, organizational structure, processes, and dynamics. Thus, a different set of management tools and frameworks are required to lead family firms and to advise family owners in their approach to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) concerns.\n\nThis course is structured around 3 themes with a focus on Asian family firms: 1) Sustainable family business, 2) Environmental and social impact, 3) Governance and succession. Through case studies, guest speakers, and interactive discussions, the course will equip students with the conceptual frameworks to a) understand the dynamics of family-ownership in Asia, and b) apply the structures, tools, and techniques to enable next-gen leaders and advisors to family firms in the pursuit of sustainability goals."

It is important to emphasize that the goal of this course is not the ethical or moral transformation of students but to develop a set of tools and frameworks (where possible) that allow us to manage effectively in a world increasingly characterized by stakeholders with competing needs and responsibilities."

In 2008, for the first time, more people lived in urban areas than rural areas. In 1950, 30 per cent of the world’s population was urban, and by 2050, 66 per cent of the world’s population is projected to be urban (based on the forecast of 9 billion people).

        "description": "This new MST course rests on the assumption that there is a powerful synergy between sustainability and innovation in business and society. The term ‘sustainable innovation’ refers to the creation of new market space, products and services or processes driven by social, environmental or sustainability concerns. Just like general innovation, sustainable innovation goes way beyond incremental improvements of products, services, or processes. The challenge is to proactively embrace risk management and sustainability considerations (environmental, social, financial) aimed at aligning (novel) business strategies with the Sustainable Development Goals to create and capture new value. If governed well by results-oriented, socially aware sustainability leaders embedded in a ‘good’ governance structure, sustainable innovation governance results not only in greater effectiveness at (intra)organisational levels but also helps to create a cleaner, healthier, fairer (and hopefully more stable) world as envisaged by the circular economy. The urgent need for enhanced sustainability innovation governance has never been greater as evidenced by rapid population growth, pollution, (toxic) waste, plastic accumulating in our oceans, limited natural resources, climate change etc. This course will introduce students to the dos and don’ts of integrating sustainability into business practice based on effective policies, processes and frameworks, board governance, senior management strategy, and stakeholder management. Several case studies of for-profit and nonprofit organisations such as City Development Limited (CDL), DBS, SIA, Eco Ark, and others will be featured to appreciate what it takes to make sustainable innovation governance work."

Executives of firms seeking to enter these markets must take important strategic decisions on the key marketing drivers in the emerging markets strategy process. This course is structured to provide students with a ‘real-world’ understanding of marketing in emerging markets, with a focus on Asia. You will work with raw market and brand data from a fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry and case studies of market entries into India and China. You will learn about the successes and failures of these firms, and discuss, debate and explore alternate strategies that you believe could work better. The emphasis is on a practical application of marketing knowledge and principles and on gaining confidence dealing with the real world issues of emerging markets."

        "description": "The course introduces Marketing as both a professional and an academic discipline.  As a profession, marketers identify consumer needs, determine which target markets to serve, and develop an optimal product, pricing, promotion, and distribution strategy that best satisfy consumer needs, relative to competition. These decisions—product, price, promotion, and distribution—flow from a rigorous analysis of the constantly evolving market environment and consumer needs (for example, the recent rise of ethical, sustainable, and socially responsible consumption). Marketers serve a vital role in the long-term success of all organizations, profit-oriented as well as not-for-profit, small as well as large. Academically, marketing is a multi-disciplinary field involving the concepts, theories, and methods used to understand exchanges and long-term relationships between buyers and sellers. Through a combination of lectures, discussions, videos, individual and group assignments, and case analyses, the course is designed to cover the fundamental concepts and principles of this challenging field.  It is a required course for marketing majors, which complements the theories and skills taught in many of the other majors at SMU."

Students will cover this course under two parallel themes–the process of selling and the role of the professional sales team through the process of sales management. Students will learn the underlying body of marketing theory that underpins the study of sales management and personal selling. You will also learn some of the important principles of effective presentations related to sales proposals to organizational customers. A key delivery for this course would be for students to develop a case scenario to simulate a sales strategy involving target prospect calling, sales presentation and negotiations leading to sales conversion. The sales management course is focused on consumer trade marketing (pushing products through the channel) as well as business-to-business marketing applications for sales of business products and services to corporate customers."

Instead, the best marketers understand that customers do not behave rationally and that even the best plans are constantly fine-tuned. Most importantly, great marketing provides a framework that creates a bias for action , not a bias for never-ending analysis and planning. Results only come when you actually try something, not think about trying something."

Ultimately, the end outcome of IMC is its impact on the brand in terms of its ability to elevate brand awareness, brand recognition and ultimately brand preference and loyalty.

The key to success is thought to lie in thoroughly understanding what these needs and wants are and ensuring the best fit between what is offered as a product and what is desired. This market-led approach, unfortunately, is myopic in its neglect of other stakeholders, such as the environment and the community. This course takes an alternative perspective, premised on climate change, deterioration of the marine ecosystem, and social inequalities as realities. It first examines how current consumption patterns are harming the environment and communities. It then delves into what responsible consumption entails and how consumers can be influenced to make product choices that are sustainable. Theories in psychology will be drawn on to provide that understanding of consumer behaviour. The course will also examine what companies can do to ensure that their marketing activities are aligned with sustainability goals. Case studies of companies with strong sustainability initiatives will be used to illuminate current best practices."

        "description": "Marketing activity is the core of an operating business.   It provides the managerial focus for interfacing with customers and the source of intelligence about customers, competitors, and the general environment.  Managers must identify and measure consumers’ needs and wants, assess the competitive environment, select the most appropriate customer targets and then develop marketing programs that satisfy consumers’ needs better than the competition. Further, marketing focuses on the long-run relationship of a company to its customers as well as short- run sales and profits.\nAfter three decades in which information technology (IT) was viewed by most senior executives as belonging solely to the “back office” of accounting and hum-drum transaction processing, IT has broken out. In many executive suites today, the talk now turns to the Internet, to electronic commerce, to knowledge management to network economy and to the issues involved in utilizing IT for “business transformation.” Understanding the new economy, which is at the interface of technology, economics and marketing is essential in successfully managing businesses in the future.\nIt is clear that, in an increasingly competitive global world, businesses must transform themselves to be more productive, to gather and store customer and competitive information and to capture the “tacit” knowledge that each employee holds in his/her head. Large software companies such as SAP, i2, and Oracle tout the potential to transform operations, supply chains, and customer relationships. A successful implementation of one of their software can provide new or better information to an organization’s decision makers, and enable global manufacturing and distribution processes. On the other hand, botched implementations can stymie product and service deliveries and prove extremely costly in at least the short term.\nFirms are transforming their entire supply chain. At one end of the supply chain, companies like GE and major automobile manufacturers are demanding that all their suppliers interact with through the Internet. On the other end of the value chain, both Internet start-up companies and more established brick-and-mortar firms are enabling customers throughout the world to buy from them through the Internet. Increasingly, firms are enabling their customers to look into their internal systems to assess when orders will be delivered.\nIndustries themselves are rapidly changing form and business methods. The music industry, for example,  because  of  MP3,  (even  after)  Napster,  peer-to-peer  networks  (like  Gnutella, LimeWire) and Apple’s iPod and iTunes has undergone major transformation. More music is sold on-line than on CDs (Independent, may 12, 2012; http://www.independent.co.uk/arts- entertainment/music/news/more-music-downloads-sold-than-cds-7807443.html ). Amazon now sells more eBooks than printed books (BBC, August 6, 2012; http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19148146 ). New services have been created, some successful, such as on-line auctions (eBay, Ariba) and some not so successful such as grocery store delivery (Webvan). Partnerships and alliances are forming among former competitors, like competitors in technology services or transportation, in order to provide end-to-end services to large customers. New companies have emerged which have changed the way we communicate and share (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest) and pay (PayPal, Square). Google has led the way to monetize search (96% of its $39 billion revenue now comes from online advertising; http://venturebeat.com/2012/01/29/google-advertising/ ).\nOne of the main objectives of this course is to provide you with an understanding of the strategic marketing issues faced by firms in the network economy, with special emphasis on how this has affected traditional and technology firms. This course should equip you with conceptual frameworks and analytical tools required to understand the new economy and manage fast paced traditional and technology businesses."

Social network ad spend will reach $11 billion in 2014, 62% of it will be spent on Facebook (eMarketer, November 2012). \n\nThis new media presents many challenges to marketing professionals. Where once much of the ad spend devoted to traditional media was typically one way (i.e. from the firm to the consumer), the explosion of social media demands a two way conversation. The increasing use of user generated content and the platforms that facilitate their influence means that the firm does not have control on what messages are being circulated about the firm and its brands. Understanding the digital technologies, the social media tools and the mechanisms by which consumers get influenced is important in developing future marketing communication strategies. This course provides frameworks to understand the new digital marketing landscape and mechanisms on how firms can effectively develop their digital marketing strategies."

        "institution": "SMU",
        "description": "Virtually all decisions involved in developing an effective marketing mix for a product or service rely on in-depth knowledge of the consumers who comprise the target market. The success of many companies and non-profit organizations—whether they be Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, Apple, or TWG Tea—lies in genuine insights into the minds, hearts, and behaviors of their target consumers. Thus, a clear understanding of the principles, concepts, and results of consumer behavior is critical to success in marketing. However, while all of us are\nourselves consumers, our intuitions about our own behavior as well as that of other consumers are unfortunately often inaccurate. This over-reliance on our own intuition has led managers astray, resulting in poor managerial\ndecision making for their organizations.\n\nThe purpose of this course is to help students gain insights into the principles and processes of consumer behavior. In doing so, students will be able to use their understanding of consumer behavior to evaluate and develop effective marketing strategies. To achieve these learning objectives, in this course we will directly\nexamine extant theory and research concerning the behavior of the consumer, with the goal of understanding how marketing managers can use these ideas to design their marketing programs. Knowledge of consumer behavior requires an understanding of important theoretical concepts from related fields such as psychology, sociology, economics, etc. Given the nature of the subject, while marketing applications will be discussed throughout the course, this course will be heavier on theory compared to other marketing courses."

        "description": "Marketing activity is the core of an operating business.   It provides the managerial focus for interfacing with customers and the source of intelligence about customers, competitors, and the general environment.  Managers must identify and measure consumers’ needs and wants, assess the competitive environment, select the most appropriate customer targets and then develop marketing programs that satisfy consumers’ needs better than the competition. Further, marketing focuses on the long-run relationship of a company to its customers as well as short- run sales and profits.\nAfter three decades in which information technology (IT) was viewed by most senior executives as belonging solely to the “back office” of accounting and hum-drum transaction processing, IT has broken out. In many executive suites today, the talk now turns to the Internet, to electronic commerce, to knowledge management to network economy and to the issues involved in utilizing IT for “business transformation.” Understanding the new economy, which is at the interface of technology, economics and marketing is essential in successfully managing businesses in the future.\nIt is clear that, in an increasingly competitive global world, businesses must transform themselves to be more productive, to gather and store customer and competitive information and to capture the “tacit” knowledge that each employee holds in his/her head. Large software companies such as SAP, i2, and Oracle tout the potential to transform operations, supply chains, and customer relationships. A successful implementation of one of their software can provide new or better information to an organization’s decision makers, and enable global manufacturing and distribution processes. On the other hand, botched implementations can stymie product and service deliveries and prove extremely costly in at least the short term.\nFirms are transforming their entire supply chain. At one end of the supply chain, companies like GE and major automobile manufacturers are demanding that all their suppliers interact with through the Internet. On the other end of the value chain, both Internet start-up companies and more established brick-and-mortar firms are enabling customers throughout the world to buy from them through the Internet. Increasingly, firms are enabling their customers to look into their internal systems to assess when orders will be delivered.\nIndustries themselves are rapidly changing form and business methods. The music industry, for example,  because  of  MP3,  (even  after)  Napster,  peer-to-peer  networks  (like  Gnutella, LimeWire) and Apple’s iPod and iTunes has undergone major transformation. More music is sold on-line than on CDs (Independent, may 12, 2012; http://www.independent.co.uk/arts- entertainment/music/news/more-music-downloads-sold-than-cds-7807443.html ). Amazon now sells more eBooks than printed books (BBC, August 6, 2012; http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19148146 ). New services have been created, some successful, such as on-line auctions (eBay, Ariba) and some not so successful such as grocery store delivery (Webvan). Partnerships and alliances are forming among former competitors, like competitors in technology services or transportation, in order to provide end-to-end services to large customers. New companies have emerged which have changed the way we communicate and share (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest) and pay (PayPal, Square). Google has led the way to monetize search (96% of its $39 billion revenue now comes from online advertising; http://venturebeat.com/2012/01/29/google-advertising/ ).\nOne of the main objectives of this course is to provide you with an understanding of the strategic marketing issues faced by firms in the network economy, with special emphasis on how this has affected traditional and technology firms. This course should equip you with conceptual frameworks and analytical tools required to understand the new economy and manage fast paced traditional and technology businesses."

Taking the viewpoint of the CEO and the general manager, the course will focus on three over-riding themes: \n\n- Successful marketing strategies deliver superior customer value; \n- Successful implementation of these strategies requires orchestrating the entire value network and marketing mix in an effective and consistent manner; and \n- Marketing innovation can be used as a driver for changing the existing rules of the game in an industry."

Given its wide applicability and relevance, behavioural science has gained immense popularity in the last few years in its study and effective application in business contexts. In particular, the success of many companies and non-profit organizations—from Apple, BMW, Coca Cola, Disney, to Zara—lies in uncovering insights into the minds,hearts, and behaviours of their target consumers. These behavioural insights are based on what science tells us about systematic patterns in the behaviour of people in taking actions, making decisions, and forming intentions.\n\nIn this course, we will take a deeper look at the role behavioural science plays in people’s path to action, whether it be search, evaluation, purchase behaviour, or more. We will examine how brands and companies leverage the theories and principles of behavioural science to shape, shift, or even completely disrupt people’s preferences in marketing contexts—with the aim to better achieve marketing objectives and positively impact the bottom line. We will also discuss the tools to implement and measure the impact of behavioral science. To achieve these learning objectives, in this course we will directly examine extant theory, research, and scientific findings concerning the behaviour of individuals, with the goal of understanding how marketing managers can use these ideas to design their products, advertising, and marketing programs."

This call for responsiveness comes from not just consumers, but also employees, the government and society at large.\n\nA major driver of these issues is how much the world consumes and the type of products that are manufactured and consumed. Marketing has a significant role to play in tackling sustainability problems and it behooves marketers to equip themselves with the knowledge and skills that will enable them to be mindful and responsible marketers. Increasingly this will be a charge for marketers in all firms, large and small – B2C and B2B, local and international – to be sensitive to the environmental impact of all a marketer does.\n\nThe first half of the course examines the social and environmental impact of current consumption patterns and looks at how consumers can be influenced to make product choices that are sustainable. Theories in psychology will be drawn upon in looking at ways to change consumer behaviour and in examining the relationship between consumption and wellbeing.\n\nThe second half of the course looks at how traditional marketing tools can be modified and how new tools can be effectively applied to market sustainable products more effectively. For example, it delves into how a product can be designed, promoted, priced and distributed to mitigate its environmental impact over its entire life cycle (from supply chain to disposal). Case studies of companies with strong sustainability initiatives will be used to illuminate current best practices."

        "institution": "SMU",
        "description": "Traditionally, consumer behaviour research can be roughly divided into two approaches. One approach takes an “Information Processing” (“IP”) perspective. In this perspective, the focus is on how/what consumers pay attention to, how they learn, how memory works in storing/retrieving information, and how this information affects consumers’ attitudes, purchase intentions, and so on. There is thus a strong emphasis on the psychological underpinnings—such as memory structures and processes—and on their impact on persuasion and attitudes. \n\nThe second approach takes a “Judgment and Decision Making” perspective and is generally referred to as Behavioral Decision Theory (“BDT”). In this approach, the focus is to compare how one should behave (i.e., normative behavior) against how one actually behave(i.e., descriptive behaviour).  There is thus a strong emphasis on the “outcome” variable of consumer judgment and decision making process—such as judgments, choices, and decisions—and attempts to chronicle and explain how such behaviour deviate from normative behaviour.\n\nOur course will introduce you to these two common approaches in consumer behaviour research. In the first part of the course we will be devoting our attention to understanding the “process” variables in consumer behavior through the IP perspective. In the second part of the course we will be looking at the “outcome” variables of consumer behaviour through the BDT perspective. Finally, in the last part of the course we will turn our attention to some of the contemporary topics in consumer behaviour research."

The primary objective of the course is to provide such students with the concepts and tools needed for collecting and analyzing behavioral data.  A secondary objective is to provide these future academic reviewers the foundations for the methodological evaluation of other behavioral researchers' work.  The course thus covers the designs and analyses that are most often used by experimental researchers in the following fields: marketing, organizational behavior, and psychology.  Topics include: factorial designs, repeated (within-subject) and mixed designs, fractional (e.g., Latin squares) designs, analysis of covariance, etc.\n\nWe will examine these designs and analyses from the perspective of an applied behavioral researcher, not from that of a statistician.  That is, we will emphasize the actual use of proper data collection procedures and analysis techniques for rigorous (i.e., publishable) theory testing.  Although there will be sufficient coverage of statistical concepts (to ensure that the procedures and techniques are applied intelligently), we will not focus on statistical theory per se (as would related courses in a statistics department).\n\nIn addition to the objectives mentioned above, the course will offer students an opportunity to get started with the use of SAS, one of the most widely used statistical programming languages for manipulating and analyzing data.  While this will not be a course on SAS itself, students should become comfortable with this platform by the end of the course.  This comfort will eventually allow them to move on to more complex applications using SAS (or similar languages)."

The underlying philosophy of this seminar is that the gains of interdisciplinary and multi-method research far outweigh the pain and inconveniences associated with leaving one’s “comfort zone.” Thus, for example, we will discuss how substantive marketing issues (e.g., reward programs, choice-set effects in retail, crowdfunding, product assortments) could benefit from an interdisciplinary marriage of methods (e.g., experiments and process measures, secondary data analysis, econometric and theoretical modeling). We will also read and analyse various articles that apply consumer behaviour insights on marketing practice.\n\nBesides examining prior work and highlighting the benefits of cross-disciplinary research, the goal of this seminar is to improve your ability to identify interesting research questions and develop effective methods for testing them. In each session there will be a few required articles that will be analysed in detail. In addition, for most sessions there will be several additional background readings. While these additional readings are not mandatory, they are highly recommended as a starting point should you develop interest in that specific substantive area.\n\nClass sessions will involve different components. We will, of course, discuss the assigned articles. When you read each of the assigned paper, make your own notes and write down questions. Try to understand (1) what is the research question being addressed, (2) what is the methodology used (and why it was chosen), (3) what are the main findings, (4) what are some possible alternative explanations to the results, and (5) how the research can be improved or extended (i.e., directions for future research). In some sessions, students will identify research ideas that build on the issues raised in the articles. The class will also develop methodologies for testing identified research ideas. In addition, you will be asked to e-mail the instructors (prior to every class) a brief bullet-point commentary on each article (further details will be given during our first meeting).\n\nFinally, each student will be expected to write a paper presenting an original research idea and including the following: \n• Very brief and very relevant literature review;\n• Detailed conceptualisation and hypotheses generation;\n• Detailed operationalisation and method;\n\n• A stylised model, capturing the essence of the studied phenomenon (note: you need to show that this model is empirically testable) and;\n• Very brief discussion. You will be asked to discuss and present your research idea in class (see class schedule). The instructor’s approval for the topic and general methodology of the research is required. The paper is due by in Week 15 and should not exceed 20 pages (tables, figures, and references included). Your final course grade will be based on class participation (40%), the brief article commentaries (10%), preliminary proposal #1 (5%), preliminary proposal #2 (5%), and the research paper (40%)."

This course will directly help students in the execution of their research projects, in handling reviewer comments, and may help them to come up with novel research ideas. Students will gain hands-on experience in applying the methods discussed.\n\nThe course starts by introducing students to the various sources of quantitative data that may be encountered in marketing. More specifically, the course will cover questionnaire and experimental data, novel types of data such as data from eye tracking and text mining, and sources of secondary data such as consumer panels and scanner data. In addition, the differences between cross-sectional, temporal, and panel data will be discussed. Finally, the link will be made between the different sources and types of data and causality. Then, the focus will shift to data analysis. The data analysis part of Empirical Marketing Models will start with an introduction to SPSS and basic hypothesis testing. Next, regression models will be discussed. Students will gain hands-on experience in specifying and estimating linear additive and multiplicative marketing models, both in SPSS and in Stata, and will learn how to derive elasticities. Next, common problems, and their solutions, will be discussed, including multicollinearity, endogeneity, serial correlation, and heteroscedasticity. Given that marketing data often comes in the form of panel data, e.g., transaction data for many customers over time, students will be introduced to random and fixed effects panel data models. Binary logistic regression models will form the next topic to allow students to analyse such variables as purchase incidence or coupon redemption. For new products no sales data are available. Conjoint analysis will be discussed as a solution to this problem. Cluster and factor analysis, two forms of multivariate data analysis, will be the next topics. Cluster analysis, or unsupervised machine learning, is an important tool for creating customer segments, and factor analysis is important when working with a (too) large number of correlated variables. Empirical Marketing Models will end with a discussion of various new developments in marketing models."

        "description": "Traditionally, the accounting function’s role is always viewed as that of a steward, the control centre for the organisation, rather than the catalyst for enterprise growth. The term ‘back office’ is often used to describe the operating nature of accounting function. So in today’s volatile global business environment, the key challenge for accounting function is how to lead the enterprise in its growth strategies while ensuring effective risk management and stewardship of the enterprise.\n\nWith complexity and data proliferation, increasingly the CEO and the board turn to accountants to help make sense of all the data, to help cut through this complexity, and to provide more informed analysis on the business and its operation. The opportunity for accounting function is if it can generate the insights that help make better corporate decision making, while continuing to ensure effective control of the enterprise, its reputation as a catalyst for growth will be guaranteed. To do so, traditional accounting departments may have to transform themselves into ‘intelligent accounting functions’.\n\nIntelligent accounting functions run their operations as cost effectively as possible, leveraging technology to reduce finance operating costs; strengthen stewardship and control so as to establish a solid foundation to support growth. The biggest challenges, however, lie in creating the efficiencies needed to gather and process basic financial data and continue to deliver traditional finance outputs while at the same time redeploying their limited resources to enable higher-value business decision support activities.\n\nThis accounting analytics practicum which adopts SMU-X approach, focuses on a few key topics that are vital to establishing an intelligent accounting function (refer to the diagram below): finance strategy and transformation, lean finance and finance shared services, business intelligence analytics, and enterprise process management. In this experiential learning course, students from various disciplines learn what comprises a highly optimised accounting process, design an end-to-end process management and explore the underlying accounting IT systems and advanced data analytical applications. By working closely with instructors from accounting and information systems disciplines, together with an industry partner, students are expected to carry out design and development of an intelligent accounting function solution. The whole idea is to engage students in real-life application and to encourage students to creatively apply concepts to practical problems in their pursuit of solving real-world problems. Students will apply the concepts in real projects."

Data analytics is significantly changing the way auditors approach and conduct audit, where data is now brought to life to allow an in-depth risk assessment and more continuous real-time audit procedures to be performed – subjecting entire populations to audit procedures, not just samples.\n\nThis course examines the application of data analytics in audit based on an underlying risk-based methodology with real-life examples. Students will also learn about practical aspects in the audit analytics process such as extraction, transformation and loading of data as well as the actual execution of audit analytics tests and visualisation of the results in software such as Tableau.\n\nBy the end of the course, students, in their respective groups, are expected to conceptualise the application of audit analytics in real-life companies through development of prototype dashboards. Guidance from Deloitte audit partners will be provided through meetings with the students throughout the course."

This shift in paradigm is driven by increasing stakeholder demands and performance expectations as well as growing public scrutiny after some spectacular corporate failures around the globe. \n\nWhile the board of directors holds statutory responsibility for effective governance, risk management and assurance, it is expected that appropriate GRA frameworks, policies and procedures are in place to ensure these accountabilities are working. In the context of sound board oversight, the Code of Corporate Governance (2012) prescribes that the CEO and CFO provide the board of directors with an annual assurance regarding the effectiveness of the company’s risk management and internal control systems. This places the CFO with prime responsibility to over GRA frameworks and practices.\n\nThe purposes of this course are to provide participants with an overview of governance principles to achieve corporate objectives; the essentials of risk management to respond to threats affecting these objectives; and lastly, assurance principles and practices to assure the integrity of the governance and risk management frameworks.  GRA is more than merely a set  of policies, systems, processes and practices. Its fundamental thrust is to inculcate a culture of doing the right thing within the business and societal contexts. \n\nThis course adopts complementary strategic and stakeholders’ perspectives of GRA. The stakeholder approach is designed to expose participants to the conflicting roles, influence, power and objectives of the parties that contribute to the corporation’s’ value creation process. \n\nParticipants will study the GRA framework to create and preserve corporate values (see below) and their importance in achieving corporate objectives. \n\nTopics covered include corporate governance models (including code), risk management (e.g. ISO 31000, COSO) and relevant assurance frameworks as well as analytical tools for effective GRA practices. To further develop on these frameworks, the course provides participants on insights on their applications in relation to risk governance, financial reporting, fraud and M & A."

Whether  in  the  form  of  informal  and  organic relations  (e.g. J-pop and K-pop  cultures),  or  as  part  of  carefully  devised  diplomatic  strategies (e.g. China’s  ‘going  out’  policy), culture  has  often  played active  roles in  our  societies  and  influenced political, social, and economic processes. This course will introduce students to the notion of culture as an integral component of international relations, and will explore the relevant concepts and practices ascribed to it. In particular, it will focus on understanding the importance of culture to contemporary governance and socio-political relations, principally within the context of Asia. This will be established through the exploration of the distinctive role played by culture during crucial historical moments, such as World War II, the Cold War, the post-Asian Financial Crisis, and our contemporary digitally interconnected societies.  Emphasis will be placed on the associations of culture with concepts such as soft power, development aid, and identity-building, among others."

This module introduces students to the significance of the arts and culture in the world of the everyday by exploring the rapidly-evolving relationships between various cultural forms, institutional sites and the practices of everyday life. Through the analysis of a range of culture industries – from screen media to music and fashion – this module will provide a nuanced understanding of how culture industries work, why they work as they do, the meanings they offer to consumers and participants, and the broader conceptual and practical implications of their management structures and functions. Ultimately, it will enable students to interrogate the naturalised meanings and rich textures of the arts, culture and creativity in their everyday lives, in relation to questions of cultural production, distribution and consumption."

In our increasingly complex and diverse society, the arts has become a powerful resource capable of bringing people together across boundaries and building stronger connections. Additionally, the art world has become a horizontal global matrix consisting of multiple constellations and routes, where art is practiced, produced, circulated and experienced in a complex ecology of artists, spaces, intermediaries, communities, activities and networks. Attendant with these developments is a diversification and dispersal in the ways in which arts, community and engagement intersect.\n\nThis course will provide students with an understanding of the role, significance and impact of partnerships and publics to the arts, especially in the context of Singapore. Through real-world case studies and experiential learning, this course will investigate the diversity of forms, practices, and strategies used to engage meaningful relationships with partners and publics. The course will also explore how the arts relate to changing landscapes and configurations of communities, ranging from the neighbourhood to the nation-state, and from groups defined in ethnic and racial terms to social classes.  \n\nUltimately, this course aims to provide students with a reflexive understanding of the significance of developing and maintaining meaningful partnerships and publics to the cultural competency, equity and sustainability of the arts, as well as foster a heightened understanding of the ties between the arts, self, society and culture."

Can the arts and culture become key drivers of urban growth, enabling cities to forge and maintain global connections? Do they differentiate cities, and generate distinctive place-identities amidst a globalising world? How do art events and exhibitions like biennales influence cultural and city development, and give rise to more diverse, reflective and vibrant societies?

For this reason, pitching can be both incredibly terrifying and exhilarating at the same time. \n\nUnderstanding the fundamentals as well as the mechanics of pitching will take you far towards successfully pitching your ideas. And there’s nothing like good, old-fashioned practice with plenty of feedback from peers and experts to help you hone your pitching skills. In this course, we will explore the fundamentals and mechanics of effective pitches and put into practice everything we are learning week by week towards becoming successful pitchers. \n\nWhile many people think of pitching as only useful for those who need to raise money (for example, a start-up pitch), pitching is actually an essential skill for reaching agreement on almost any subject. Agreement can yield many outcomes: management buy-in for developing a product or service, closing a sale, securing a partnership, recruiting an employee, securing an investment, and even securing employment for yourself. \n\nNancy Duarte, a communication specialist, put it this way: “Companies are started, products are launched, climate systems are saved – possibly based on the quality of presentations. Likewise, ideas, endeavours, and even careers can be cut short due to ineffective communication.” In this course, you will be given a good foundation for successful pitching so that no worthy idea or endeavour of yours will fall short simply because it wasn’t effectively conveyed."

Yet, most communication efforts in organisations tend to be directed externally. Internal communication is often misunderstood and is generally assumed as unnecessary as employees are expected to accept and comply. Recognising the importance of internal communication begins with the acknowledgement that organisations comprise sentient, thinking and diverse individuals who might not be readily agreeable and invariably obliging. Internal communication is fundamental as it can enable organisations to align missions and goals, cultivate common beliefs, coordinate activities, develop a shared identity and facilitate decision-making. Through project work with an external partner organisation and a variety of experiential in-class activities, this SMU-X course invites students to synthesise theories, frameworks and best practices from industry to address real-life business challenges affected by internal communication."

You will also learn how to create trust and build personal connections, discover the elements of successful leadership, and be exposed to frameworks that will provide guidance as to how to develop an impactful and results-driven communication strategy, and gain exposure to practical examples as well as learn from cases. \n\nAs you go through this process of learning, you will understand what it means to be an engaged employee. You will learn how to use participatory, collaborative and strategic tools to influence management approaches to employee communication. Before you become a leader, and even when you are a leader, you are first and foremost an employee. Since communication is a two-way process, both the leader and the employee need to comprehend the rules of engagement – this is what the course will impart – a toolkit for effective employee communication in today’s project-centered, matrixed, or virtual organizations.\n\nTo hone your learning, you will be asked to practice what you learn by participating in a capstone project in which you will develop an employee communication plan for an assigned company."

        "description": "If management is like slaying monsters, change management compares to fighting monstrous hordes. Firstly,  because the specific change situation is often unique and therefore outside management´s comfort zone. Secondly, because change can only be successful if all stakeholders (investors, employees, media etc.) support the process. Change operations fail often enough and become crises. Therefore true change leaders are also true communicators (or get their advice) – involving and persuading multiple and often conflicting stakeholder groups. Since change has become commonplace in business, change communication is today a pivotal function of leadership.\n\nThis case-based course aims to prepare students for the handling of communications during the most regular change processes: mergers & acquisitions; restructuring & divestments; turn-around programmes; corporate scandals (actual or perceived)."

This course introduces students to emerging, efficient methods of data collection: namely, text mining techniques using R programming. Students will learn how to: (a) manage data with the R programming language; (b) collect data from social media (i.e. Twitter) and a web-search volume indicator (i.e.Google Trends); (c) conduct sentiment analysis; (d) perform a statistical technique to enhance brand positioning (i.e. multi-dimensional scaling), and; (e) visually display data in order to gain insights, to aid managerial decisions in a competitive environment.\n\nNOTE: There is a reason for scheduling this course at the beginning of the MCM program with classes over five consecutive days. This is a hard-skill course in which students will learn about R coding languages for data analytics and visualization. It is expected that students have no background in R programming; however, it is essential for students to practice both during and after the 5-day course period the programming skills they have learned in order to fully grasp the course content. Analogously, learning R programming is like learning how to play the piano—hands-on practice with R programming is of critical importance in learning the course content.

Indeed, organizations (operationalized as governments, corporate, not-for-profit, or even prominent individuals) are, literally, experiencing and battling crises of some form or other. This can be internal crises like miscommunication, personality clashes; to external crises like Covid-19, policy mismanagement, or terrorism. Due to the vulnerability of the organization to both internal and external uncertainties, no organization is immune from crises.\n\nWhile organizations recognize the probability of the occurrence of crises, studies have shown that many do not have any preparation or plan to deal with them. Some do not find it necessary to take preventive measures; others simply do not know where to begin, and what to do.\n\nThis course aims to equip leaders like you with the necessary skills and abilities to prepare for organizational crises, diagnose the nature of the crises, communicate during crises, and learn how to lead. The emphasis, thus, is on the preventive, rather than reactive, aspects of crisis management.\n\nScholars agree that crisis management is a dynamic, ongoing process, through a life cycle. You will be taken through each step of the life cycle of a crisis, with the aim of helping you learn what you need to do at each phase. While many scholars have posited different frameworks, for this course, Wilcox, Cameron and Reber’s (2015) proactive-strategic-reactive-recovery framework is adopted because of its emphasis on the preventive aspects."

Students are also free to work with any profit and/or non-profit organization on an existing or new project they may have, provided such opportunities exist and are offered to students.  \n\nAs idea champions, students work in groups, to develop/invent a prototype/model or mobile application or put into place a process, program or plan such as a business plan that will value-add and contribute to the needs of the beneficiary or organization of their choice. It is entirely up to the leadership of the organization concerned whether they would consider implementing or not implementing what students have designed. In other words, there is no compulsion for any organization to eventually sponsor the proposed ideas to the organization(s) concerned or may be collaborating with.\n\nThe outcomes of the group project for students are outlined as follows:\n(i) Students will learn about leadership from the leaders they are connecting with. For example, they will learn how and why today’s leaders are engaged in community-based or social initiatives in Singapore and beyond. \n(ii) Students will also learn from the leaders lessons on leadership and/or teamwork based on the leaders’ experiences.\n(iii) By undertaking a hands-on group project, students will also learn practical lessons as well as the complexities of teamwork based on their OWN experience and process of working internally, with their group mates and externally, with organizations outside of school.\n(iv) Each student will also reflect on his/her own learning throughout the project from start to end as outlined below (see ‘Reflection Essay’ for details).\n(v) Students will also fulfill other learning objectives that include cognitive and academic development as outlined below in the section, ‘Learning Objectives’"

Innovation and maturation, systems and regulation, risk and failure are the key notions that exemplify this dynamic relationship. In this course, we will analyze what science is, how it works, and how society provides the means and framework for scientific and technological knowledge. We will draw from various perspectives in the humanities and social sciences, including those of history, anthropology, sociology and public policy to explore different forms of interaction between science, technology, and society. In other words, we will examine the connections between scientific theories and practices, and our social, cultural, economic, and political lives. Specific topics covered include nuclear power and waste, regulation of the internet, data and self-hood, as well as climate change politics. The first unit introduces central ideas in Science and Technology Studies (STS). In unit two, we focus on assumptions and authority of science and technology, asking who benefits from how particular research agendas or new technologies are designed, and who bears the risks of living with uncertain science or dangerous technologies. The final unit explores controversial issues in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), and examines how policy-makers, scientists and STS scholars have addressed conflict and controversy."

It adopts interdisciplinary perspectives from science and technology studies, urban studies and urban planning, critical policy studies, geography, and sociology to evaluate the nature, scale, and effectiveness of these solutions to city challenges locally and globally. Drawing on case studies internationally as well as from Singapore, students will learn about: (a) different technological tropes of urban solutions; (b) the history and culture of technocratic problem-solving in the urban context; (c) the global capitalist landscape of urban solutions providers, in particular technology companies; and (d) Singapore’s peculiar standing as a self-styled, ideal-type ‘model’ of urban solutions, particularly for countries and cities in the Global South. Particular emphasis will be laid on the increasingly important role of technology companies as suppliers of ’solutions’ for urban challenges, as well as on critical perspectives of place, politics, and power, to continually ask questions of who has the power to define ‘problems’ and ‘solutions’.  Over thirteen weeks of readings, field-trips, and seminar discussions, students will learn to problematize and critically reflect on the contradictory conceptions of ‘solutions’ and ‘problems’ in the context of (global) metropolitan governance from the distinctive position of a putative ‘model’ city."

In this class, we will explore how technological artifacts and systems— from the ships early factories to the internet—have shaped (and are shaped by) social, cultural, economic, and political factors. The course’s underlying premise is that “technology”—a concept that carries a multifaceted ideological baggage—only makes sense when understood as being embedded in specific social, material, and ideological configurations. That is to say, there are histories of technologies. Instead of a comprehensive survey, the course will unfold through chronologically arranged topics that include the emergence of industrial society, imperial mobility, urban spectacles, systems of mass production, gendered consumption, digital cultures, risk in the Anthropocene, and technological imaginings. The unifying theme weaving all these topics together will be that far from being deterministic, technology is instead better understood as a site of contestation and negotiation for different visions of society. So that students can dig deeper into those tensions, each week will feature not only scholarly readings, but also two primary source-driven case studies in which groups will explore the complex intersection between technology and society—including Singaporean rickshaws, the Magnitogorsk Soviet industrial city, the contraceptive pill, and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.

However, epidemics and pandemics are not just biological phenomena—they are also intimately intertwined with society and culture. Throughout history different communities have found diverse ways to make sense of and tackle the rapid spread of disease. In turn, those intense experiences have shaped questions concerning rights and responsibilities, the boundaries of belonging, and risk and prevention. This course introduces students to the different ways humanists and social scientists have approached the study of communicable diseases in the modern era. It begins with discussions of how to talk about and how to frame this field of study, and then follows a loosely chronological structure—starting with nineteenth-century debates about the nature of cholera and ending with the complex relationship between emerging viruses and globalization. On the way we explore how tropical diseases helped shape and were shaped by colonialism; the networks that connect diseases, vectors, and populations; the fraught history of vaccine resistance; the massive mobilization in response to the devastating 1918 influenza pandemic; and the way stigma and activism has defined the HIV/AIDS pandemic."

        "description": "This course is aimed at anyone who wants to gain an understanding of climate change, the moral problems it raises, and the responsibilities we have, individually and collectively, because of it. This course will consider several interrelated issues connected to climate change. Such issues include: What ethical challenges does climate change raise? Who has a right to what emission levels? How do we negotiate between collective and individual self-interests? What would\nconstitute a just allocation of the burdens of climate change? What can economic analysis tell us (and not tell us) about climate change? In what ways does uncertainty challenge our ability to understand what we should do about climate change? Why might geoengineering be morally problematic? What are we individually and collectively required to do about climate change? What are our responsibilities toward future generations and the environment, and how do we take these into account?\nThis course will examine the science, and look closely at the interplay of science and public policy. It will also look at the role of values in science.\nThis course will approach these issues from a variety of perspectives. Readings will drawn from climate science, philosophy, economics, environmental studies, public policy, and popular media, among other sources."

First, a professional matter which involves machine learning or the Blockchain. Second, you will work with a lawyer! This course gives you a toolkit, a shorthand for constructive dialogue with a lawyer’s concerns, to solve your problems within your domain expertise.\nConsider this example: what is your understanding of a “token”? A banker might think about asset ownership records, and link a “token” to “accounts”. To a programmer, a “token” could be a technical standard for a fungible unit of value on the Blockchain. In contrast, a lawyer understands a “token” based on legislation or judge-made law. Significantly, lawyers have an exclusive right to advocate for all your professional interests in a court of law.\nThis course will cover legal reactions to technological innovations in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. We will examine case studies in Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain concerning, for instance, autonomous vehicles and smart contracts, which are dumb contracts.\nLawyers are trained to shape these realities with words by manipulating natural language. You will understand how – and why - lawyers convert the realities of algorithms and codes into legalese to mitigate harm against persons, to aid commercial growth and resolve its disputes."

Electronic commerce has become ubiquitous as is digital forms of human interaction and communication. Also, Internet intermediaries have taken on a major role as facilitators of commercial and non-commercial transactions online. These include social networking platforms (e.g. Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok and Twitter), multimedia sharing platforms (e.g. YouTube, Apple Music, Spotify), search engines and news aggregators (e.g. Yahoo and Google), content hosts and storage facilities (e.g. Dropbox) and many others. Law and policy have to be adapted to deal with the roles and functions of such forms of engagement and the parties involved. Regulators in every jurisdiction are faced with the challenge to manage the new economy and players, and to balance the interest of multiple parties, in the context of areas of law including intellectual property, data protection, cloud technology and cyber-security. The social effects of the development and use of Infocomm technology have to be tackled as well, including privacy, harassment, cyberstalking and access to content.\n\nStudents taking this course will be introduced to the legal issues and solutions arising from transactions through the use of digital information, goods and services as well as via non-physical - analog and digital - channels of communication and delivery. The technological developments from Web 1.0 to 2.0 and the future of Web 3.0 with its impact on human interaction and B2B/B2C commerce as well as e-governance will be examined in the context of civil and criminal law. In particular, this course examines the laws specifically arising from and relating to electronic transactions and interaction and their objectives and impact on the individual vis-à-vis other parties. Students will be taken through the policy considerations and general Singapore legislations and judicial decisions on the subject with comparisons and reference to foreign legislation where relevant. In particular, students will be introduced to the policy behind, and the general effects of the law, relating to electronic commerce and other forms of transactions.

We will use a diverse set of ethnographic case studies to examine the structures and systems in which climate knowledge and responses are embedded, as well as the complexities of making both atmospheric carbon and its lived impacts legible across domains. The difficulties of scale – climate change’s dual character as both an existential, species-wide threat and a particular, localized set of material challenges – will also be emphasized throughout. In addition to considering the insights of climate anthropologists, students will develop their own ethnographic research skills through in-class methods exercises. They will then apply these tools in the course's culminating assignment, an extended ethnographic case study of climate change knowledge, subjectivity, or response within Singapore."

        "institution": "SMU",
        "description": "This course uses some of the most pressing global problems to motivate learning of the concepts and methods of game theory. Game theory is the branch of mathematics that deals with strategic interactions: situations where the benefits and costs of each agent or actor depends not just on her actions but also on the actions chosen by other agents. Many problems of global concern, like climate change, the use of artificial intelligence, pandemics, and great power conflicts, are characterized by the tension between self-interest and cooperation, miscommunication, and misalignment of incentives. Game theory is a powerful and incisive tool to analyse these issues because it has been used extensively to address collective-action challenges, which are at the heart of most game-theoretical applications in the social sciences; moreover, solutions to these challenges must account for information manipulation and unintended consequences, which are core game theory concepts.  Collective-action problems are situations where the objectives of the whole society or collective are best served if its members take a particular action or actions; however, as these actions are costly, and one can free-ride on others’ actions, individuals are disincentivized from cooperating. To solve these problems, game theory looks at how the strategic interaction among members can be improved to generate cooperation.  This course is designed for non-economics majors who want an accessible but also comprehensive and challenging introduction to the game-theoretic tools and principles essential for understanding the nature and possible solutions to collective-action problems without taking a standard game theory course. It is placed ideally within the Technology and Society basket, as it addresses social dilemmas and issues with conceptual or technological links to science."

        "description": "This course conceptualizes food and food consumption as a deeply spatial, political, economic and socio-cultural phenomena. Through interdisciplinary perspectives from anthropology, geography, political economy, sociology and cultural studies, we will explore diverse case studies, problems, politics and perspectives about food. Students will interrogate the centrality, complexity, creativity and conflicts surrounding food over societies, time and space. The examination of food, with particular attention to Singapore, will encompass discussions on issues including the ethics of food production/consumption, patterns of diet and dieting, the politics of sustainable food production, and hybrid food cultures. Students will also examine contemporary global responses to the global food shortage and pay special attention to food cultures in Singapore as the metropolitan kitchen in which we are active participants. Through readings, focused questions, discussions and assignments, students are also invited to reflect on their own patterns of food consumption."

        "institution": "SMU",
        "description": "Nations have long sought to evoke loyalty and personal attachment, while in turn providing those living within it with a collective experience and common destiny. The potent force of the nation as a cognitive idea is at the heart of this course, which conceives of the making of a nation as an ongoing work in progress in which everyone has a stake. The central question that we will investigate concerns the reciprocal influences between the nation, its institutional manifestations and ‘the people’. How do ‘the people’ shape institutions and fashion a nation on a daily basis and vice versa?\nTo explore these relationships, the course is structured around three themes: prerequisites, process and practice. The first theme provides the general conceptual framework through a series of brief discussions of what a nation is, how it relates to a state and to a ‘people’. The second theme is devoted to what is often seen as the quintessential nation-building moment: the formal drafting of a constitution. We will consider the choice of language in that text to harness the people’s fidelity to the budding nation as well as the respective roles played by the elites and ordinary citizens during the constitution-process. For the third theme, we will probe the lived reality of how the nation constitutes itself every day through its people, from the elites who claim to speak on behalf of the nation in formal rule-making to the personification of the nation in image, song and icon to the architectural design of state institutions and public spaces and the wearing of folk costumes or traditional outfits that seek to give expression to the identity of the nation.\nOur explorations will feature the experiences of a diverse range of nations located within and outside Asia. These will provide the backdrop against which the Singapore story will be considered, thereby allowing students to interrogate the familiar domestic narrative of nation-building from a comparative angle. The approach taken will be practically grounded and interdisciplinary, drawing on insights from law, political theory, history, linguistics, architecture and the arts. To do so effectively, the course will be team-taught by two instructors with complementary disciplinary backgrounds."

The notion of the third age was introduced by gerontologists as it became clear that the discourse on ageing covers a heterogeneous group of individuals who may be of the same age chronologically, but who in terms of personal characteristics and life experience are quite different. This third age of human existence is characterised by retirement from full-time work and a new way of spending time (Carr & Komp, 2011). Through class discussions and group projects, students will dive deeper into disciplines like gerontology, social sciences (intergenerational; social connectedness), public policy (successful ageing), economics (retirement) and technological developments in the ageing space. Students will explore case studies and challenges of a rapidly ageing society in Singapore and around the world such as Japan, China, USA, Australia, Netherlands etc."

        "institution": "SMU",
        "description": "Humans have been making war and peace throughout their recorded history. We can be fairly certain this was the case well before civilization emerged. Conflicts always seem to erupt over scarce resources, contentious values and ideas, fissures in relationships, fault-lines in societies, the list goes on. And, intertwined with these conflicts are efforts to end violence, to heal wounds and reconcile, to share resources, to create or re-establish a semblance of harmony between peoples. Most of all will perceive these human activities as binary opposites, as mutually exclusive, leading us to invest particular meanings in each to distinguish them further from each other. Indeed, thanks to influences from culture, media, from our communities, families and leaders, we typically perceive war and peace as suffering versus happiness, action not stillness, a zone of masculine combat versus one of safety for women and children, and much more. These ingrained perceptions shape our decisions, actions and relationships in fundamental ways, determining our behaviour and experiences in all spaces and times, whether we have construed them to be in the context of war, peace, and anything beyond or in-between. Since our views of war and peace are so fundamental to our life experience, this course asks us for a deeper engagement of our prior knowledge.\n\nThrough critical engagement with a variety of disciplines and empirical contexts, we will consider the intertwined phenomena of war and peace in theory and praxis. The course explores the value systems we attach to each, why, and with what consequences for ourselves and others? We investigate how our notions of war and peace contribute directly to the construction of our identity as well as ideas about belonging, power, justice, progress, and more. In so doing, we look into the ways people, their customs, laws and culture respond to their perceptions and experiences of war and peace; reflect on how they debate the purposes of war-making and peace-making; and discuss how they compete and cooperate for the spoils of both war and peace. Also, we will study how our knowledge of war and peace may continually change over time. By the end of the course, students will have an expansive understanding of how these two phenomena come together in ways that structure and define their everyday lives."

We begin by tracing the formation of ‘Orientalist’ stereotypes about Asia in World Literature, illuminating the role these texts played in the Western colonial project. Next, we interrogate how Asian nationalists and creative practitioners sought to move beyond these Orientalist tropes by adapting Shakespeare’s plays to create bold, new intercultural performances. We then dive into a range of canonical Asian texts and their contemporary adaptations. We ask what these texts can tell us about the connected political, cultural and technological histories of Asia and Europe; probe how these texts play shape our perceptions of racial, religious, national and gender differences; and ponder the place Singapore writers have in world literature today."

        "description": "Hailed as “the greatest book on democracy ever written,” Tocqueville’s Democracy in America offers a window into much more than the United States visited by Alexis de Tocqueville in the 1830s. Indeed, Tocqueville believed he “saw in America” an image of the future everywhere, for he believed that equality of conditions from which democratic society grew was the world’s inevitable future.  Having reached its most developed form in the United States, equality of conditions modified and transformed all aspects of life, from politics to social relations, to personal relations, to intellectual life, to individual character and values. Given this radical transformation of the world, Tocqueville believed that “A new political science is needed for a world entirely new,” and Democracy in America articulates this new political science.  Tocqueville’s masterpiece, then, looks beyond its US context, for Tocqueville hoped to teach his readers what they could hope and fear from democracy, as well as how democratic society might be “educated” to avoid some of the dangers to which it is prone. \n\nThis course takes its inspiration from Tocqueville’s ambition, by approaching Democracy in America thematically and using Tocqueville’s study as a basis for broader inquiry into features of contemporary democratic society. Each week of the course will focus on a key theme in Democracy in America, and each week will pair that theme with current scholarship applying and extending elements of the Tocquevillian perspective to contemporary contexts. By the end of the course, students will have gained familiarity with key elements of the Tocquevillian analysis of democratic society as well as critical perspectives on how these themes have continued to play out in current scholarship and debates."

        "description": "This course explores what literature can tell us about the changing nature of gender and ethnic identities across modern Asian cultures. We interrogate what ‘selfhood’ means to a range of established and emerging Asian writers, asking how and why they construct gender and ethnic identities in their works, and what insights this provides into the Asian psyche. We begin by interrogating gender in Singapore, asking how dramatists and novelists envision life as a ‘woman’ or a ‘man’ here. We then circle outwards across Indonesia, India and Iran, tracing how letters, novels, films and graphic novels have been used to create and challenge gender norms from the colonial 19th century to the postcolonial 21st. Next, we look at ethnicity, debating its relative mutability, and querying the importance of physical markers of ‘racial’ difference relative to evolving national borders and spiritual and societal practices. We trace how Singaporean and Malaysian writers construct ethnicity in their prose fiction, before considering how authors further afield in East Asia (Japan and China) and West Asia (Turkey and Afghanistan) have re-interpreted communal identities over time. We conclude by considering the future of ethnic and gender identities in Asia. By the end of this literary odyssey, students will have gained a wide-ranging appreciation of how modern Asian writers envision gender and ethnicity, and contemplated the relevance of these fictive visions to their own sense of selfhood as young adults living in Asia."

Culture also encompasses attitudes, values, assumptions and prejudices, and the rituals and practices that express them. In this regard, our current thoughts and acts have an ancestry which cultural history can illuminate and critically examine.\n\nThis course explores fundamental moments in the history of Europe: from the foundations in Greece and Rome, through the alliances, conflicts and revolutions that transformed it, and key periods such as the Enlightenment and Modernism, that significantly shaped it. They all help understand the complexities of today's Europe, from the challenges in cultural integration to Brexit. Through lectures, key readings, analyses of case studies and research projects, this course broadens understanding of Europe. By establishing linkages between history, socio-political and economic contexts, religion, and art forms, it reveals crucial intersections to comprehend the landmarks of the cultural history of Europe."

        "description": "The pursuit of wealth in its various forms has been prominent throughout recorded history. The desire to accumulate resources is found across civilisations. Yet, should wealth simply measured in economic and financial terms? Should poverty be only measured through the same lens? Many cultures promote the virtues of prudence and fortitude, peppered with ideals of justice and equality in its various guises. Wealth and poverty are often seen as diametric. Despite this, several traditions point to the need for thinking through forms of wealth (and poverty) beyond the conventional lens of economics, and to consider the pursuit of wealth of time, happiness, peace, relationships, and other elements that enrich the human experience. It is little wonder that in our contemporary age, several scholars have pointed towards the reprioritisation of wealth accumulation towards one that places happiness, health and other non-monetary goals as the ideal. In this course, we will be exploring substantially several forms of wealth (beyond the conventional), and to consider carefully the causes and strategies to address the challenges related to wealth and poverty in our contemporary world.\n\nThrough critical engagement with a variety of disciplines and empirical contexts, we will consider the intertwined phenomena of wealth and poverty in theory and praxis.

Also, we will study how our knowledge and conception of wealth and poverty may continually change over time. By the end of the course, students will have an expansive understanding of how these two phenomena come together in ways that structure and define their everyday lives."

In this course, we explore the ways in which film has served as a space for the production, contestation, and meditation of representations and images of Asia in the United States through the lens of Hollywood films.\nThis course is designed to provide an interdisciplinary and visual approach to understanding Asia's representations and images on/in Hollywood films. First, we will briefly explore America’s perceptions and ideas about Asia in the late 19th century and discuss various methods of reading films as texts. Second, we will\ncritically examine what Hollywood films reveal about America’s perceptions and ideas about Asia within the context of Asia’s entangled history with the United States from the late 19th century to 1990s - from the period of American imperial expansion, America’s orientalism, US occupation of Japan, the Cold War, and\nAmerica’s involvement in Vietnam. Next, we will explore the recent trajectories in Hollywood that shaped/reconfigured Asia’s filmic representation - the commodification of Asia in Hollywood, the impact of 9/11 on Hollywood’s image of Asia, and the shifting aspects of Asian identities (gender and race) in\ncontemporary Hollywood films. Finally, we will examine the rising influence of Asia (its film industries, states, and societies) in global/Hollywood filmmaking and discuss how these disruptions and changes will impact Asia, the United States, and the rest of the world."

        "description": "In the Western world of the mid-19th century, change was everywhere. Industry boomed, and the pace of life increased, leading to relentless urbanisation and a boost in mobility and communications. Travelling and the notion of taking a holiday were growing in popularity and a ‘culture of things’ primed consumerism as an expression of social status. While the abolition of slavery had begun, nationalism exploded in a Europe where Imperialism brought large parts of Asia and Africa under colonial rule and introduced new interactions, dependencies, and exploitations.\n\nArtists strove to find new ways of encapsulating this complex world through their creations. With the advent of photography and film, and new building and artistic techniques, some of the most exciting changes in art history took place. This period gave us creative universes as diverse as Monet’s open-air impressions, Renoir’s zest for life, Toulouse Lautrec’s underground worlds, and Van Gogh’s anguish.\n\nThroughout the 20th century, new sets of media and art forms appeared, and the social structure of the art world consolidated. New construction materials were used, artistic techniques developed, and a multitude of isms (Cubism, Futurism, Expressionism, etc.) challenged previous conventions. Artists supported and even championed the advancement of social causes. They were often at the forefront of protest movements against wars and injustices and denouncing discrimination by race, gender and sexual orientation. Today, contemporary art simultaneously experiences greater accessibility and democratisation. At the same time, it also suffers an increasing level of commodification and continues to evolve as it finds new ways to innovate, inspire, and provoke its audiences.\n\nThis course examines crucial works of art from the nineteenth century to the contemporary. It provides students with a roadmap to reflect on them in an open-minded, critical and analytical way. It considers historical, economic and socio-political contexts, and focuses on the integration of art within the broader cultural environment. This course offers new perspectives into the shifting kaleidoscope of art, and by its conclusion, students will develop a profound understanding of artworks that might have previously seemed inaccessible."

We will primarily draw on the fields of environmental studies, anthropology, cultural studies, history, geography, and sociology to critically examine the multifaceted dimensions of the Anthropocene in the region.\n\nIn this course, we will explore contemporary debates around climate change, capitalism, biodiversity, and political and cultural ecology to understand the complex and interrelated challenges posed by these issues. In doing so, it will challenge us to rethink what it means to live, be, and thrive in the Anthropocene Asia. This course invites students to go beyond disciplinary paradigms and consider how emerging issues in the Anthropocene demand new ways of thinking, learning, and acting. Ultimately, we aim to foster a critical awareness of the Anthropocene and its impact on Asia, and to explore possibilities for sustainable and equitable futures."

It is characterised by both patterns of continuity across time and space, as well as far-reaching and rapid social and physical change. This course surveys a variety of contemporary trends and challenges found across Asia. By exploring weekly themes such as urbanisation, transnational migration, civil society and social movements, religious politics, security issues, environmental degradation, geopolitics and the role of China, economic growth and disparity, and regional structures like ASEAN and SAARC, students will gain a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics of contemporary Asian societies. At some points in this course we will approach ‘Asia’ with a wide-lens, taking global, transnational, and regional perspectives, while at other times we will zoom in to particular experiences at a national or sub-national level. This is a survey course, and while students will be exposed to a wide range of issues relevant to contemporary Asia, they will also be encouraged to delve deeper into one or two select topics that are of particular interest to them."

This course provides the knowledge needed to advise individuals and businesses on issues arising from the proliferation of digital media.\nWe start by exploring the fundamentals of digital media: its key players, growth, regulatory challenges, and governance approaches. Then we delve into key concerns about the creation and consumption of digital content. Some questions we will try to answer are:\n• Are we doing enough to protect Internet users from the growing range of online harms?\n• How do we hold anonymous threat actors accountable for objectionable online conduct?\n• Is there room for cancel culture in online discourse? Should we legislate against it?\n• How far should censorship extent now that so much content is so widely accessible from so many information streams?\n• Should we actively regulate generative AI at the risk of stifling innovation and growth?\n• Do individuals like you and I have a right to our own image in cyberspace?\n• What should legal and regulatory issues should content creators and online platforms be concerned about when doing business?\nThis course balances policy and practice. On a conceptual level, we will study regulatory challenges, approaches, regimes, and gaps. On the practical front, you will learn how to guide digital-media industry stakeholders (such as content creators, game developers, news sites etc) through common legal and regulatory issues.\nOver the course, you will learn about the governance challenges and social issues brought by digital media. More importantly, we will think critically about these complexities and emerging issues in a framework that focuses on keeping users safe while helping the industry thrive."

Instead of exploring models and constitutional solutions in the abstract, the course invites students to explore the practical impact and outcomes particular constitutional models and ideas produce in everyday life. To that end, we will amongst others compare the constitutional responses that different countries provide to contemporary challenges such as how to ensure effective public participation in governance without encouraging populism; the pervasiveness of migration for our understanding of citizenship and its entitlements; ensuring that everyone is treated equally while respecting individual autonomy and life choices; the role of technology in public life and the implications for privacy and free speech; and the role of a constitution in fostering economic development."

How do modern and critical accounts of law shape our thinking about the nature and purpose of law? How does adopting a particular account of law impact the practice of law? How can we, as lawyers or citizenry, harness law’s potential as a tool for transforming society?\n\nThrough this course, students will have a unique opportunity to engage their hearts and minds in relation to the concepts of law and justice.

The EU and ASEAN are among the world’s most advanced regional structures, representing distinct models of integration. Since the 1980s, the evolution of EU-ASEAN relations has offered valuable insights into the multifaceted concept of interregionalism in international law and relations. ASEAN became a priority in the EU’s Asia policy agenda following the Treaty of Lisbon, and the European Commission’s 2015 “Trade for All” strategy articulated an ASEAN approach based on individual agreements, culminating in a region-to-region framework. The recent conclusion of the EU’s trade and investment agreements with Singapore and Vietnam reinforces this incremental approach towards realising the EU-ASEAN free trade agreement.\n\nAmidst China’s changing status, the impasse in WTO negotiations, and the COVID-19 pandemic, EU-ASEAN legal frameworks and relations have gained prominence on the global stage. In 2020, the two blocs upgraded their “Dialogue Partnership” to a “Strategic Partnership,” which aimed at enhancing economic and security cooperation, sustainable connectivity, and development. In 2021, the EU’s Indo-Pacific strategy underscored its engagement with the ASEAN-led regional architecture, particularly in light of the economic and political impact of the CPTPP and RCEP.\n\nIn this SMU-X course, students will explore EU and ASEAN institutions and examine the EU’s new Indo-Pacific strategy from legal and political perspectives. The course will specifically evaluate EU-ASEAN economic agreements and focus on cutting-edge areas such as trade and investment liberalisation, AI and digital trade, and sustainable development. Students will gain practical experience by collaborating with legal and policy experts to tackle real-world challenges.\n\nPlease note: This course does not include an overseas trip and does not meet SMU’s global exposure requirement.

More and more cities around the world are becoming increasingly popular as economic powerhouses and magnets for migrants from the countryside, suburban areas and other parts of the world. All big cities in both First and Third World countries as well as emerging markets such as New York, London, Tokyo, Paris, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, New Dehli, Jakarta etc. have to cope with high population density and serious challenges such as air pollution or traffic congestion. How do we pack more people into big cities and yet continue to achieve a high quality of life? How do we create and manage ‘good cities’ which are safe, spacious, green, connected, fair and resilient? How can cities create economic wealth while still fulfilling the CSR responsibilities of sustaining a “Green Planet”? What are the best practice designs and technical smart city solutions which could be leveraged to tackle these challenges and how can they be successfully commercialised? This course will provide answers to these questions with special emphasis on the managerial and commercial aspects of smart city concepts. \n\nThe key lies in creating and effectively managing innovative and sustainable, smart cities able to leverage on new technologies such as smart grids or sensor networks to create a place where people can live, play and work well. Starting from the stakeholder requirements of citizens and planners of innovative cities, the course will introduce students to urban design concepts as well as commercialization, management challenges and implementation issues of the smart city model. There will also be a focus on how good governance and enabling technologies such as sensor networks can facilitate the creation, management and sustainability of ‘good’ cities.\n \nWith the help of case studies and resource persons such as industry leaders, innovative city designers, tech experts and business development experts from local and int. companies such as ST Electronics, JTC, Jurong Consultants, Frost & Sullivan, IDA International, Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) etc., students will be familiarized with the opportunities and challenges of the ‘smart city business’ which represents a key element in the value creation and extraction strategy of the Singapore Government and related businesses."

        "description": "This course is a response to the increasing use of robotics, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and digital technologies in business and society. Drones are unmanned, multi-purpose tools. Their history can be traced back to World War I when the US army experimented with unmanned aerial torpedos. Nowadays, drone technology belongs to the military arsenal of many nations. Drones serve many purposes (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance etc.), and they can be deadly. In business and society, drones are utilised to capture images of people and/or buildings, to monitor agricultural conditions, to take pictures from (or of) hard to reach places, to assess the impact of climate change on rainforests, to film events, to deliver parcels, to survey real estate, to deliver help to heart attack victims in remote areas via a flying defibrillator or to fly life-saving kits to swimmers in emergency situations. In view of their increasing importance in terms of commercial value creation, R&D (it is estimated that about $6.4 billion is spent annually for R&D on drones), job creation, innovation (e.g. Internet of Things), new forms of warfare as well as legal/moral-ethical/regulatory concerns, it is imperative that students learn to critically appreciate the multiple and often conflicting implications and consequences of this technology for business and society. To achieve that, students will have to read widely and familiarize themselves with the various functionalities of robotics, UAVs and digital innovations in order to critically assess these technologies and to articulate informed opinions about ‘the good’, ‘the bad’, and ‘the future’ of these novel technological developments. The course will be taught by a multi-disciplinary team of instructors plus exposure to tech entrepreneurs and digital (corporate) innovation champions."

As A.I. technology is already surpassing human decision-making in certain instances, there is growing concern about ‘uncontrolled A.I.’ in business and society, incl. regulatory and ethical-legal challenges. Against this background, this new course aims to equip students with foundational, theoretical and practical knowledge about A.I. driven business applications in selected private and public sector organizations. Besides reconstructing the history of artificial intelligence from the 1960s to the current era (as well as a refresher about the basics of computer science algorithms such as audio and video compression algorithms), we will put emphasis on explaining the A.I. driven business models of several top international and local organizations. In order to appreciate the power of A.I. technology, we will take a closer look ‘under the A.I. hood’ to understand what makes machine learning, deep learning, neural networks and image analysis tick. Visits to A.I. powered business organizations engaged in customer service management, finance, marketing, supply chain management or manufacturing will be organised aimed at appreciating both the benefits and downside of A.I. Students graduating from this course will be equipped with critical competencies to solve real-world business problems using A.I. technology while simultaneously casting a critical eye on the morality and ethics of commercialising A.I."

        "description": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has bloomed this year, entering the lives of many students and the general public’s use. Historically, there have been different types of AI, but the type underlying the most popular and current AI – neural networks – has become greatly influential in recent years, and has actually been working in the background of many applications for several years already. This AI technology resembles human thinking at neural levels, but are not clear matches to how humans process knowledge. The are now adapted to process language and images, and underlie the most popular kinds of AI, such as ChatGPT and Midjourney. As such, we will focus on these types of AI.\n\nStudies of AIs’ impacts from just a few years ago are already outdated due to the rise of these new AIs. In part, this is because the current AI has shown itself to be capable of many feats. This has led to a surge of funding of AI startups, and the emerging industry could be expected to supercharge some firms, tasks, and types of work.\n\nIn order to understand the implications of this type of AI, we will investigate the differences in types of AI and the current technologies that have so attracted investors, firms, and users alike. We will delve into human intelligence and concepts of how intelligence, understanding and meaning are conceived to exist in humans, and to be created in AI.\n\nWe will focus on two implications of the new types of AI. (These will be grounded in the understandings of human intelligence and AI arrived at in the first part of the course). The first is the implications for how work tasks can change (based partly on your own experiments and introspections), and consequently, on the future of jobs and employment. Much of this will be based on the direct use of ChatGPT to assess its capabilities for various kinds of work.\n\nA second type of implication we will study from this grounded basis is that of how different kinds of AI firms and startups, and uses of AI, are emerging. Since much of the impact will come from the embedding of AI in the broader automation of work systems and firms, the broader context will be kept in mind. A business model approach will be used to study these forms of entrepreneurship and transformation.\n\nThe course does not employ mathematics or computational work, but AI applications are used and explored, but generally involves higher levels of reasoning, and multi-disciplinary approaches."

These three challenges (positioned at the interface of both current and future issues) are not only globally relevant but also have significant local implications for Singapore.\n\nEmbedded in the experiential SMU-X initiative, the Transformative Leadership course provides students with a unique learning opportunity to develop and implement (socially) innovative solutions to make a positive impact on business and society in close collaboration with reputable partners in business, nonprofits and government. Learners will be paired up with an external SMU-X partner to work on relevant innovative projects with real impact.\n\nThe successful completion of such transformative SMU-X projects requires learners diving deep(er) into various disciplines such as social sciences, business, political governance, public policy, demography, technology, etc. It is expected that the chosen practical challenges commissioned by SMU-X partners will ‘stretch’ students, forcing them to step out of their comfort zones and to explore the unknowns in order to make a ‘real’ difference ‘out there’ in both the social and business sectors.\n\nIn terms of effective leader development, in particular, transformative leadership, the SMU-X course design will support learners in expanding their individual capacity to be effective in leadership roles and processes. Emphasis will be put on proximal indicators of leader development such as self-views around self-concept, including leader self-awareness, leadership self-efficacy and leader. Through their SMU-X projects, students will appreciate the importance of leadership development so that they can articulate what it takes for teams and their leaders to create strong(er) alignment and high(er) levels of commitment. The latter requires interpersonal trust, care and concern as well as shared mind-sets regarding (transformative) goals and values such as the ‘real’ sharing propelled by collaborative leadership approaches."

This affects our attention, emotions, cognitions, well-being, functioning, and performance. It challenges our ability to flourish, to both feel well and do well. In this course, we explore the science and practice of mindfulness as a way of flourishing at work and in life. Mindfulness-based practices are rooted in Eastern contemplative traditions but have been adapted to a secular, modern context. A large amount of research has accumulated, showing that such mindfulness-based practices confer numerous benefits both for well-being and functioning, including at the workplace.\n\n“Mindfulness at work” has two meanings in this course: First, we will focus on mindfulness in the context of work and organizations. Second, we will incorporate mindfulness practices such as mindfulness meditations into the course itself. Thus, in this course, we will examine both the science as well as the practice of mindfulness. For the science aspect, we will read and discuss scientific research studies on mindfulness related to each of the course topics. For the practice aspect, we will engage in mindfulness practices based on established and carefully designed secular mindfulness trainings. The practice aspect is integral to this course and students will be required to commit about 20-45 minutes daily to these practices. Evidence suggests that the practices can help individuals feel and function better and are a good investment of the students’ time."

Since independence, Singapore’s leaders lament its lacking natural resources to justify their “pragmatic” management of the everyday lives of Singaporeans, including speech, educational environment, sexuality, religious expressions, ethnic identity and political culture, at the expense of citizens’ rights. Populated dominantly by ethnic Chinese with Malays and Indians as minorities, yet geographically surrounded by Muslim-majority nations have made the ruling PAP reluctant to observe multiracialism in governance policies which compromises the nation-building project. Presently, forces of globalisation threaten the state’s monopoly over political space and ideologies. This module targets students interested in developing a critical appreciation of the socio-economic and political contexts that structure Singaporeans’ daily lives. It highlights critical historical circumstances that shape Singapore’s post-independent governance policies, political discourses and contemporary development as a nation-state. It sharpens students’ sociological imagination as they deconstruct political ideologies to grasp alternative interpretations of the development of Singapore society and make sense of contemporary issues of importance in Singapore and to Singaporeans."

ABMS systems are particularly powerful if we want to describe a system populated by many independent and heterogeneous decision makers (who can be collaborators or competitors). ABMS systems can also be used in performing policy evaluations and generating decision supports, as we can then computationally test how changes in parameters at different levels would affect various performance indicators.\n\nBesides covering theoretic foundations of ABMS, we focus heavily on hands-on learning as well. In particular, we will expose students to NetLogo, an intuitive yet powerful modeling language for building ABMS systems. We will be learning NetLogo by building several classical ABMS examples incrementally in class.\n\nObjectives\nUpon successful completion of this course, a student will be able to:\n• Understand what is an ABMS.\n• Evaluate the pros and cons of using an ABMS system in describing selected real-world phenomena.\n• Utilize ABMS systems in policy/strategy evaluations.\n• Appreciate the importance of considering uncertainty and opponent modeling when designing strategic, tactic, and operational policies.\n• Complete the full cycle of building an ABMS system using the NetLogo programming language:\n  o Design an ABMS system with a proper level of granularity and fidelity (defining agents and means of communications).\n  o Validate and calibrate the built ABMS. \n  o Interpret the outcome of the ABMS system."

While these AI techniques have demonstrated remarkable, occasionally superhuman, performance across numerous applications, there is a growing concern regarding their safety and security. It has been shown AI systems are subject to a range of attacks, ranging from adversarial attacks (i.e., perturbing an input slightly causes an AI to make completely wrong predictions), backdoor attacks (i.e., backdoors can be easily embedded in neural networks), and privacy-violating attacks such as membership inference attacks (i.e., an adversary may reliably infer whether a certain sample is used during training or not). In addition, AI systems can inherit or amplify biases present in their training data, potentially leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. Furthermore, many AI models, including GPT, are complex and not easily interpretable. It makes understanding how these models make decisions highly nontrivial, even though it is crucial for trust and accountability.\n\n\nThis course aims to present a systematic view on the range of AI safety problems that have been identified, analyse their root causes, and study potential approaches to mitigate the safety and security risks. In particular, we will focus on answering two key questions. First, given an AI system, how do we systematically evaluate its safety risk? Second, given an AI system that potentially has safety issues, how do we systematically mitigate the risks? This course will feature real-life AI safety issues on popular AI systems such as ImageNet, GPT and so on."

The course then moves on to a dynamic\nframework and covers the mechanics of long-term economic growth and the role of policy in economic development. Students are then introduced to dynamic decision problems when considering consumption and savings decisions of households and investment decisions of firms, and these building blocks are combined with a Walrasian approach to the labor market to complete the development of a dynamic macroeconomic model, which is then used to consider fiscal policy questions like the role of the timing in taxes and government expenditures."

        "description": "The income per capita in the United States and Western Europe is around fifty times greater than in much of sub-Saharan Africa. This prompts the question: Why are some countries rich and others poor? From around 1870 until the Second World War, Japan’s income per capita remained around 25 percent of U.S. income per capita. After the substantial reforms put in place at the end of the war, Japanese relative income rose sharply so that today Japanese standard of living is roughly two-thirds that of the U.S. level. The rapid catch-up was also achieved in the post-war period by several other Asian economies including Singapore. What is it that makes it possible for countries to produce growth miracles? For much of world history, people lived at subsistence levels well described by Thomas Malthus. Around the nineteenth century, however, there was an escape from Malthusian stagnation beginning in Europe. What is the engine of economic growth? Gasoline contributes to air pollution as it powers our cars. The release of carbon dioxide as oil and gasoline are burned contributes to global warming. What is the relationship between economic growth and environmental quality? These are the questions that we will pursue in this course."

Firstly, the course begins with the definition of a city, and why cities form by introducing the economics of agglomeration, and how cities interact to form the urban system of the entire economy. These factors affect all urban phenomena. Secondly, the course analyzes the internal spatial structure of a city by developing a theory of commuting, housing demand and housing production. It then analyzes transportation and land/housing issues in more detail. On transportation, we focus on the economics of traffic congestions, the rationale for congestion pricing (ERP), and the so-called fundamental law of highway congestion. The discussion on land and housing, will address various housing phenomena such as tenure choice and location. The courses will discuss the optimality of local public good provision, and connect local public finance and housing markets with land taxation. Finally, the course addresses the economics of urban planning to comprehend various urban forms that are found in different cities in the world. It will highlight key aspects of Singapore’s urban policies, such as the ERP and the Land Acquisition Act 1973. The topics for group projects cover many other urban policies in Singapore and its comparison with other countries, including but not limited to Singapore’s master plans."

        "description": "The economic environment provides many of the critical parameters for companies doing business in an increasingly integrated world. Economic expansion or recession will change all business forecasts; market structure will affect profitability; fluctuating exchange rates will have an impact on costs, sales, risk perceptions and debt levels; and the state of the national budget or interest-rate decisions can color a company ́s future. In particular, a global recession like the one suffered recently can transform consumption behavior and business strategies. Managerial Economics provides students with a framework to understand the main economic variables and dynamics that affect business activity. Understanding the microeconomy is the first stepping-stone toward achieving a full grasp of the economic world that surrounds us. Most of the world ́s countries rely on free markets to make most of their economic decisions, and those markets automatically answer the key economic questions (What will we produce? How will we produce it? At what price? Who will get it?) through the operation of supply and demand. The course will review the basic concepts of supply, demand, market failures and externalities to provide a broad perspective on how free markets work. It will then move on to elasticity and market structures and their impact on profitability. The objective is to give students a firm understanding of how supply and demand at the micro-level determine the basic parameters of doing business. Yet markets are not perfect. In our times, a period of deregulation and strong faith in markets to solve economic problems has been followed by the deepest economic crisis since the early 20th century, with devastating effects on output, income and employment nearly everywhere. The experience has brought back to the fore the key questions of how economic decisions should be made, and how much governments should intervene when market failures exist, especially in light of pressing problems such as environmental deterioration which the market appears poorly equipped to solve. The second part of the course will focus on the macroeconomy and the policies that governments follow, and how the interaction between free economic forces and policy affect the business cycle and company prospects. It will begin by analyzing the key macroeconomic indicators --GDP, inflation and unemployment and the business cycle--, and evaluate how changes in these variables affect businesses. It will then outline the dynamics of the macroeconomy, the operation of fiscal and monetary policies and how and why policy decisions are made, to give students the tools to anticipate key policy decisions and understand their impact on the macroeconomy. Finally, the course moves from the micro and national levels to the global level, for a look at international trade, exchange rates and the balance of payments. It will detail the forces of trade, the determinants of exchange rates, and the important concepts underlying the balance of payments; and how all of those elements of the international economy affect business. In the process, we will encounter an explanation for the Great Contraction that occurred beginning in 2008, and will be able to understand how the crisis has and will change our economic lives. A special focus will be given to the Asian markets to see their dynamics."

        "description": "Singapore became independent on 9 August 1965. Its per capita income was only about US$500, about the same as Mexico and S. Africa then. By 2015, its per capita income was US$56,000, similar to Germany and the US. Its economic journey began with its dependence on entrepot trade and heavy dependence on the expenditure of British bases. Today it is a global city state: a little red dot, but a global brand.\n\nSingapore is ranked by the World Bank as the easiest place in the world to do business and by the Heritage Foundation and the freest economy in the world, after Hong Kong. There are virtually no import tariffs, no export subsidies, no exchange restrictions, no price ceilings, no minimum wage, no rent control. Income tax rates are among the lowest in the world, and government expenditure as a percentage of GDP well below most countries.\n\nSingapore’s leadership over the last 50 years can best be described as innovative and entrepreneurial in their policy making. Like China, careful choice and grooming of political leaders plus an orderly succession have provided the political stability and confidence for investors, resulting in rising standards of living.\n\nSingapore’s policy approach is both pragmatic – an emphasis on what works in practice rather than abstract theory; and eclectic – a willingness to adopt best practices from around the world. Market principles and signals guide its policies such as industrial policy, medical insurance, congestion pricing, social security, regulation of utilities, or allocation of land. Nevertheless, its Government does not hesitate to intervene when markets fail. State-owned enterprises continue to exist and thrive but they are run on market principles and are not allowed endless State subsidies.\n\nWelfare programs exist but are minimal so that work incentives are not eroded. Housing, health and education are subsidized.\n\nGoing forward, Singapore faces substantial challenges: a rapidly aging population, the political necessity to limit immigrant workers, declining exports and productivity, loss of competitiveness and inequality. Its leaders are searching for a new paradigm of growth."

        "description": "Spatial econometrics consists of econometric techniques dealing with empirical problems (in regional science, economics, and social sciences) where “interactions” among geographical units, economic agents or social actors generate “spatial dependence” among cross-section units rendering classical econometric techniques invalid. Common spatial effects such as, neighbourhood effects, spillover effects, copy-catting, networks effects, and externalities, have received an increasing attention by applied researchers. Spatial econometric models and methods have been proved to be very effective tools in dealing with these issues. Applications are seen not only in specialized fields of regional science, urban economics, real estate and economic geography, but also increasingly in more traditional fields of economics and finance, including demand analysis, labour economics, public economics, international economics, agricultural and environmental economics, asset pricing model, and arbitrage pricing theory.\n\nSpatial econometric models extend classical econometric models by incorporating spatial lag, spatial error, and/or spatial Durbin terms to capture spatial dependence through spatial weight matrices and spatial coefficients. This course introduces the core set of spatial econometric models including spatial linear regression models, spatial panel data models, and spatial dynamic panel data models, and the associated methods of estimation and inference such as (quasi) maximum likelihood, M-estimation, and GMM. Common tests for spatial and/or dynamic effects, e.g., LM tests, standardized LM tests, and bootstrap LM tests are introduced. Empirical illustrations of the methods are presented using Matlab software."

How are they preparing themselves for the next phase of growth and development? What challenges do they face as they move into the future? How much of these challenges arises from the past developmental path they took. What roles do ASEAN and China play in each other’s growth and development. These are some of the issues that would be explored.\n\nThis module offers valuable insights into the evolving economic and business landscape within ASEAN, shedding light on growth opportunities and examining strategies for deeper integration between businesses in China and ASEAN. Tailored for individuals keen on grasping the intricacies of ASEAN's economic dynamics, it serves as a compass for exploring pathways toward strengthened cooperation between China and ASEAN economies."

These models have found substantive applications in social and biological sciences where the describer “panel” and “longitudinal” respectively arose. This course is primarily oriented to applications in social sciences including business, economics, education, sociology, etc. Major topics include (i) panel data models with individual-specific effects (fixed, random, or correlated random); (ii) panel data models with both individual- and time-specific effects, (iii) panel data models with heteroskedasticity and serial correlation, (iv) tests of hypotheses with panel data models, and (v) dynamic panel data models. Major inference methods such as (quasi) likelihood and GMM will be introduced. Throughout, we emphasize on models, methods and their applications with computer software STATA or R software.\n\nPart II covers models and methods for analyzing spatial data or spatial panel data. The term ‘spatial’ comes from the fact that cross-sectional (spatial) dependence exists among the spatial units so that the regular econometric methods are no longer valid for analyzing these data. Spatial dependence (or social interaction or network effect) often exists among economic agents (or geographical units or social actors), in the forms of neighbourhood effects, peer effects, copy-catting, and externalities. It has received an increasing attention by regional scientists, urban economists, econometricians, statisticians, etc. Spatial econometric models and methods have been proved to be effective tools in dealing with issues related to spatial dependence. Applications are seen not only in specialized fields of regional science, urban economics, real estate and economic geography, but also increasingly in more traditional fields of economics and finance, including demand analysis, labour, public, international, agricultural and environmental, asset pricing, and arbitrage pricing.\n\nMajor topics in this part includes (i) spatial linear regression models, (ii) spatial panel data models, (iii) spatial models with unknown heteroskedasticity, (iv) spatial dynamic panel data models, and (v) tests for spatial and/or dynamic effects in the spatial (dynamic) panel data models. In each type of spatial models, the spatial lag, spatial error, or spatial Durbin terms are used to model the endogenous\nspatial effects, contextual effects, and spatial error dependence. Common estimation and inference methods such as (quasi) maximum likelihood and GMM, and common tests such as LM tests, are introduced. Empirical illustrations are presented using Matlab or R software."

Key questions as we discuss theories of international trade are: Why do countries trade? What determines the pattern of international trade? What are the effects of international trade on income distribution? With these questions in mind, the course takes you through the classical models of trade that focus on cross-country differences as the source of gains from trade, the new trade theories that rely on imperfect competition and increasing returns to scale as the rationale for trade, and the recent models of multinational production with global sourcing of inputs.\n\nThe course continues with the welfare analysis of trade policy tools such as tariffs, quotas, and export subsidies. We compare the role of import quotas and tariffs under perfect competition and imperfect competition and study the role of strategic trade policy for international oligopolies. We study the political economy of trade protection as well as trade liberalization both at the multilateral level under the World Trade Organization (WTO) and at the bilateral/regional level. Examples of current debates in international trade that we analyze in-depth are the recent US-China trade war and the current global competition for market access in high-tech industries."

While macroeconomics is concerned with the economy as a whole, microeconomics examines the individual parts of the economy and focuses on how individuals and firms make decisions and how these decisions interact. This course is designed to introduce learners to the fundamentals of economics by exposing them to the principal theories and models used by economists. It demonstrates how economics can be used by individuals and businesses alike to assess problems and develop solutions. It also examines the wider macroeconomic environment and the principles underlying monetary, fiscal policy and international trade."

Typical questions of Industrial Organizations are: What are the reasons for different market structures, such as the number of the market participants, or the offered product variety? Further, what determines firms’ profitability or productivity? Many of the questions evaluate the effects of public policy on competition and consumer welfare.\n\nIn empirical Industrial Organization, such questions are addressed by focusing on one industry and usage of appropriate data as well as econometric tools. This course introduces the main models and tools. Empirical methods include reduced form methods with a focus on establishing causal effects, as well as empirical methods that build on theoretical assumption. We work hands-on with estimating demand functions and modeling competition. Further, we evaluate counterfactuals. Note that the course involves econometrics and coding.\n\nNote that empirical tools of Industrial Organization are in high demand in the private and academic sector. Market regulators, antitrust- and marketing-consultancies, as well as competition authorities, are using econometric methods frequently. Furthermore, methods of industrial organization are actively used in academic and policy research."

Spatial data are commonly used in regional science and urban economics (related to property prices, crime, household income, etc.), epidemiology and public health (such as disease clusters, etc.), environmental science (climate change, air pollution, ozone density, etc.), ecology, biology, geology, social interactions and network effects, and other disciplines.\n\nWe will start the course by looking at practical aspects of organising and visualising spatial data. We will also discuss how to use a coordinate reference system to give spatial awareness to a dataset and make meaningful maps – the main visual aid for spatial data. Then we will consider the statistical and econometric aspects behind spatial data analysis with a special focus on how to re-align classical statistical and econometric techniques towards spatial data for the three broad types of spatial data: (i) point patterns, (ii) areal data and (iii) geostatistical data.\n\nExploratory spatial data analysis methods, including various plots and tests for spatial autocorrelation, are discussed. Diagnostic tests for complete spatial randomness against spatial clustering or dispersion is an important step in the initial stages of exploratory spatial data analysis. Point pattern analysis and different methods used to measure the degree of spatial autocorrelation will also be discussed. Spatial econometric models and estimation will be discussed in terms of areal data. Spatial econometric models and methods are effective in modelling spatial dependence and thus useful in predicting attributes that are affected/related to its’ neighbours. We will focus on the main spatial regression models (spatial lag, spatial error, and spatial Durbin) with and without heteroskedasticity. The usual estimation techniques, quasi-maximum likelihood and GMM methods are discussed for model estimation and inferences. The course will end by discussing main methods of interpolation techniques used in spatial data analysis."

Wealth management is to grow, preserve, and transfer wealth to future generations. The traditional focus in investment management has primarily been on institutions. However, with the large growth in private wealth globally and particularly in Asia, wealth management for HNWIs is fast emerging. The course begins with a macro view on the wealth management landscape before advancing to understand the similarities and differences between managing wealth for institutions versus for individuals. With individuals, we will appreciate the need for different investment products and wealth solutions across client segments based on needs and suitability. Students will learn how to risk profile a client using behavioural finance knowledge and models, prepare an investment policy statement (IPS) for a particular client’s profile and be able to suggest an asset allocation based on the IPS. As the life cycle stages of a client progresses, the wealth advisory approach must incorporate retirement planning. Students will learn the iterative wealth management and advisory process where client profiling, monitoring and review of investment portfolios, implementation and executions of the investment plans are conducted regularly and dynamically across the life cycle stages of a client.\n\nEthical behaviour builds trust. We will examine ethical conduct in the investment advisory process and the corporate governance process of banks to encourage ethical behaviour of client advisors. Last but not least, we will introduce sustainability investing as a preference in client’s IPS and how to approach ESG requirements of the client."

In Singapore, where many key financial decisions are supported by government programmes, the ability to navigate complex systems has always been key. For example, investing and retirement planning involve a grasp of the country’s personal income tax system and the CPF system, while homebuying requires understanding the HDB system and mortgage borrowing. Health insurance choices are centered around the basic provisions of Medishield in combination with a range of options around private providers.\n\nThe scope of financial literacy is being redefined, both in Singapore and elsewhere, especially as societies begin to recognize the need for finance to be more inclusive and sustainable. The introduction of new enablers also introduces new risks, particularly in the instance of financial technology (fintech). For instance, as fintech unlocks unprecedented access to new services (such as robo advisors, buy-now-pay-later) and products (such as sustainable or “green” investment funds), it becomes increasingly important to ensure that consumers are sufficiently well-informed or otherwise protected.\n\nThis SMU-X course offers an experiential learning opportunity that allows students to translate classroom knowledge about financial literacy into practical solutions for real organizations that represent the forefront of financial innovation.  The course will focus on initiatives related to building individual financial literacy with respect to new goals and financial services in the context of each organization’s current or future business model.  Through this student consultancy project, students will learn how to solve complex business problems related to financial literacy, inclusion, and fintech, with guidance from the faculty and project sponsor mentors, from problem definition to final client presentation–while simultaneously testing their skills in real world settings."

ESG risk management is increasingly vital for companies due to several compelling reasons:\n\n1. Reputation and Brand Value: Companies with strong ESG practices are perceived more positively by consumers, investors, and other stakeholders. Managing ESG risks helps protect and enhance a company's reputation and brand value, reducing the risk of negative publicity and boycotts.\n\n2. Regulatory Compliance: Governments and regulatory bodies are imposing stricter ESG-related regulations. Effective ESG risk management ensures compliance with these regulations, avoiding fines, legal action, and operational disruptions.\n\n3. Investor Demand: Investors are increasingly considering ESG factors in their investment decisions. Companies that manage ESG risks well attract more investment and often benefit from lower capital costs. ESG performance is now a key metric for many institutional investors and funds.\n\n4. Operational Efficiency and Cost Savings: Managing environmental risks can lead to more efficient resource use, waste reduction, and energy savings. Social and governance improvements can enhance employee satisfaction and productivity, reducing turnover and associated costs.\n\n5. Risk Mitigation: ESG risks, such as climate change impacts, social unrest, and governance failures, can have significant financial and operational impacts. Proactively managing these risks helps companies avoid or mitigate potential losses and disruptions.\n\n6. Competitive Advantage: Companies that excel in ESG risk management often have a competitive edge. They are better positioned to anticipate and adapt to market changes, meet stakeholder expectations, and capitalize on new business opportunities related to sustainability and ethical practices.\n\n7. Long-Term Sustainability: ESG risk management supports the long-term sustainability of a company by addressing the broader impacts of its operations on the environment, society, and its governance structure. This holistic approach ensures the company can thrive in the future while contributing positively to the world.\n\nThis course will investigate how ESG risk considerations can be integrated into a company’s wider Enterprise Risk Management Frameworks.  Focus here will be on Environmental Risk considerations (Climate Change and Nature/Biodiversity), given the importance and regulatory focus that these attract."

To dovetail with the other course on financial econometrics, this seminar course has a focus in market microstructure. The course aims to help students in developing deeper insights into the microinnards of financial economics. These insights will be useful in their future endeavours in either the industry or academics.\n\nSome of the econometric tools that will be applied in this seminar course include the Wold representation theorem, co-integration analysis, vector autoregression (VAR), generalized method of moments (GMM), and error correction model (ECM). They should have learnt these techniques from the courses on econometrics in Term 1, or from the other related courses.\n\nSome of the stochastic processes that they should also know include geometric Brownian motion, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model, jump process and jump-diffusion process."

In my teaching (including the assignments and exams), I will minimize the use of math but focus on the economic intuition.  \n\nIn addition, students will be given the opportunity of using a comprehensive online financial markets simulation system called Stock-Trak to obtain hands-on experience (of a hedge fund manager) in trading in the “real” market. For instance, students can trade futures and options on commodities such as gold, silver, corn, oil etc at the ‘market prices’ through Stock-Trak."

Some  M&A transactions  are  pursued  for  strategic  reasons  –  to  improve  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency (synergistic) of the underlying business. M&A transactions could also be undertaken by management to pursue their own interests, such as managerial entrenchment, which would be value destroying to the shareholders. In the latter case, the market could intervene by punishing the management via the takeover market.\n\nThis course serves to familiarize participants with the nuances of the M&A market.   Specifically, it aims to explain the role that M&A play in corporate strategy development.  In this respect, some of the related questions will be explored: Why firms undertake these transactions?  What is the genesis of  value  in  these  transactions? How  much  value, if  any, is created? Who  gains  from  these transactions? What is the track record of value creation for M&A deals? How does M&A market relate to corporate restructuring?\n\nAn important focus is relating the theory to the practical aspect of a deal. Here, participants will be exposed to valuation techniques and issues; structuring considerations; aspects of M&A execution including negotiation strategies, due diligence, documentations, legal and regulatory issues. Post- acquisition integration which is a crucial part of M&A transactions will also be discussed.\n\nThis course will be relevant for those planning to pursue a career in finance or general management in a corporate setting as well as those planning to pursue a career in private equity or at a deal intermediary, such as an investment  bank.   As such, there will be some discussions on how an investment bank organizes its corporate finance department  and how this product fits with other parts of its capital raising business."

The body of knowledge in investment management has traditionally been focused on institutions. Institutions differ from individuals as most of them are tax-exempt, unlike individuals who are subject to various taxes. In addition, institutions have much longer investment horizons than individuals. Finally, the objectives and constraints of individuals are more varied than institutions. Hence, the tools and issues for investment management for individuals need to be expanded.  \n\nThe formulation of an investment plan for retirement is used as a framework for discussing the various issues in investment management for individuals. Thus, we examine the key challenges and issues pertaining to ensuring that an individual has sufficient funds to live out his/her retirement years. Issues covered include taxation, asset allocation, insurance, annuities, pensions, housing, healthcare, demographics etc.\n\nAs this is an emerging area in finance, students will not be learning a well-established body of knowledge but would learn how to think about the issues. In short, there are no quick and easy answers, but rather many questions for us to explore."

Quantitative trading strategies rely on the use of efficient and intuitive mathematical models to provide short-term forecast or to identify mispricing and arbitrage opportunities in the market. Once a strategy has been conceived, rigorous back-testing against historical market data is performed. Strategies are judged and eliminated by their profitability and feasibility. Once a quantitative strategy has passed the due diligence checks, it will be implemented as a computer algorithm and run real-time in an automated manner. \n\nThis course offers an introduction and a broad overview of the development of quantitative trading strategies over the years. It then moves on to cover a spectrum of successful and useful quantitative strategies, all of which are still being employed in the market today. The course is targeted at practitioners intending to apply these techniques in the market – all mathematical and theoretical formulations are followed by practical examples of how they are being implemented in the industry, or a case study based on real market data."

The size of financial data has experienced exponential growth. With computational resources becoming cheaper, these data can be analyzed in full to hunt for hidden patterns or relationships previously undetectable. In recent years, there is a growing need for data specialist with a strong background in financial and quantitative modelling to accelerate digital transformation in both the Singapore and global financial markets.\n\nUnlike most other big datasets, financial data is widely known to be extremely noisy with a weak signal-to-noise ratio. Many patterns uncovered are due purely to randomness. With the availability of advanced machine learning algorithms, financial data scientists with a deep knowledge of financial data properties are in demand. There is a surge of interest in exploring the application of machine learning to financial problem. For example, in 2019 JP Morgan assessed the feasibility of using AI for option pricing, while Hull (2020) explored using reinforcement learning to self-discover the dynamic delta hedging strategy for option pricing. UBS created Evidence Lab focusing in financial data science in 2017.

ESG considerations offer a multitude of benefits, both tangible and intangible including alignment with personal values, risk mitigation, potential for long-term outperformance, exposure to innovative companies, stakeholder engagement, regulatory compliance, and access to diverse investment opportunities. By integrating ESG factors into their investment decisions, investors not only seek financial returns but also contribute to positive social and environmental change. Sustainable investing has implications for all investment portfolios and incorporating ESG factors into investment decisions is becoming an increasingly important skill for anyone working in the investment industry. Investors are increasingly conscious about the impact of their investments on the world. ESG investing allows them to align their portfolios with their personal values by supporting companies that exhibit responsible practices in environmental stewardship, social justice, and ethical governance. Retail investors who incorporate ESG factors into their investment strategies may benefit from potentially higher returns and more resilient portfolios. As governments worldwide implement stricter regulations related to environmental protection, social responsibility, and corporate governance, companies that adhere to ESG principles may be better positioned to comply with evolving regulatory requirements. Investing in ESG-compliant companies can thus help investors navigate regulatory uncertainties and potential liabilities."

Students enrolled in the FTW200 will undertake the FTW200 series under the same instructor for five recurring weeks from Week 3 to Week 7 of the school term. Each component is a three-hour session.\n\nFTW201 Job Search Strategies\nJob search strategies will help students who have a general idea of their preferences or bias for certain type of job functions to explore deeper into the career of choice. Students have to perform due diligence and research the industry/job functions they are interested in and what the careers, occupation or their dream job entail and relate it back to their self-assessment and career plan. They need to conduct sufficient research into the companies of choice and how they could “navigate their way” into these companies and job functions. They also need to consider closing skills gaps, if any, and the career path and advancement. \n\nThis workshop introduces to students effective job search strategies, informational interviews, how to get insider’s information on industry and job function requirements.\n\nThe outcome is for students to make a more informed decision on their choice career and options available.\n\n\nFTW202 Resume and Cover Letter Writing \nThis workshop will equip students with the skills to write an effective Cover Letter and resume that will help them secure an internship – this is just the basic workshop as most 2nd years will not have sufficient internship or work experience to help them enhance their employability. Students will be exposed to different formats and the effective uses under various circumstances. They will be taught how to create a CV and the sections which are normally included in a CV and the contents to be featured under each section. Advanced CV writing will be taught as an elective in the 3rd or 4th year for those who want help and guidance to strengthen their CVs and start their job applications. \n\nThis workshop will focus on how to build a good resume as well as how to craft a resume and cover letter befitting to the industry and internship/job they are applying for. \n\n\nFTW203 Social Etiquette and Groom for Success\nThis workshop will deliver to students the knowledge of good personal hygiene and effective grooming and how to conduct themselves in professional and social setting. This workshop should spark their interest to discover themselves and how best to project a confident and professional image as coverage is wide and may not offer sufficient depth. Students are encouraged to do more research on their own or attend workshops which will give them the depth they desire. \n\n\nFTW204 Personal Branding and Networking Skills\nSMU has built a credible brand among the employers however, its brand attributes must also be reflected in its students. There are certain attributes that have attracted employers to SMU students, such as being articulate, innovative, intellectual curiosity, courage to challenge the status quo, adventuresome, skilful and resourceful. The emphasis should be for students to build a believable and consistent long-lasting personal brand with focus on core values for the workplace and in society, not just being well-groomed. \n\nNetworking skills are critical for students to succeed. To be effective networkers, they need to understand the acceptable decorum and etiquette for establishing business relationships and friendships; and the “how-tos” of maintaining contacts and building long-term relationships at work and play. \n\nThrough this workshop students can be more aware of developing and maintaining a consistent personal brand both in the online and offline world and become more comfortable in having conversations with other peers and professionals in both a social and work-based setting.\n\nFTW205 Interviewing Skills\nInterviews can be at times daunting and can be very stressful especially if the candidate walks into an interview without adequate preparation. Students can use the interview session to their advantage to impress the interviewers and present themselves as good potential hires. The interview session is not only to secure an internship or job but also a two way communication to explore and discover whether there is a good fit between the candidate, the job and the organizational and candidate’s expectations. \n\nThe objective of this workshop is to help students understand the objectives of the interviews, the different types of interviews and equip and practice good interviewing and listening skills in preparation for the internship/job applications."

How were the wide range of polities – such as sea nomads, hill tribes, sultanates, principalities, and bureaucratic kingdoms – reduced to the ten independent states that remain today? What was the foreign, what was the “indigenous” contribution to this state consolidation? How did colonialism and different paths to independence and post-colonial policies radically change peoples’ political, economic, social, and cultural life worlds over the course of a few generations?"

        "description": "Most people spend much of their time working. But not everyone is miserable and unhappy like the quote above claims. What some do as work (in exchange for money), others would gladly do for free. Work is something that most people engage in for economic gain, but the social, psychological, and even political impact is less often examined. Conversely, leisure is often seen as the opposite of work. But some studies indicate that people might actually feel more engaged with work than leisure activities (Csikszentmihalyi, 2008). In this course we explore what work means to people, what leisure provides that work does not, and how individuals go about finding a balance between work and non-work in their lives.\n\nBroadly, the objective of this course is to provide students an opportunity to examine and reflect on different perspectives of work and non-work, and to start them on a journey to determine for themselves what work and non-work could be like in their own lives. Specifically, through class discussions and project work, I hope to be able to provide students a broad perspective on what constitutes work and non-work. This sets the stage for them to apply these perspectives to their own lives, and to gain insights for themselves regarding a possible balance between work and non-work, both in the present and the future."

Despite its beginnings as an improbable nation, Singapore's economic success has been dependent on political stability, of which the absence of overt ethnic conflict is fundamental. Yet, stable and meaningful ethnic relations cannot be left to chance. Indeed, a very deliberate and conscious effort, requiring a mixture of laws, institutions, mechanisms and political leadership and will, is needed to maintain ethnic relations in Singapore.\n\nThis course seeks to understand and to critically examine the legal framework and policies for the management of ethnic relations in Singapore. Laws alone are manifestly inadequate in maintaining peace on hot-button issues of race, language, and religion.\n\nThe course will also examine the political framework in place that complements the legal and policy infrastructure. Comparative studies will be done, where applicable, to articulate the key themes and issues."

        "institution": "SMU",
        "description": "Organised crime is a multi-factorial social problem. The study of organised crime in Asia has stimulated empirical investigations into a diversity of phenomena including the racialisation of criminals, supply chain organisation of illegal goods and services, corruption of legitimate actors and institutions, white collar criminality, and issues related to legislative frameworks and law enforcment efforts. Although the core subject is crime, efforts to understand, control, and eradicate organised crime in Asia has never been a uniquely criminological or even uniquely sociological endeavor. Instead of a monopoly by any single discipline, research into the field of organised crime in Asia has attracted scholars with diverse academic backgrounds including, psychology, economics, history, law and political science.\n\nThis course systematically charts and analyses the multidisciplinary dimensions of the study of organised crime in Asia, by drawing on scientific research done in the field of psychology, sociology, economics, political science, criminology, and cultural studies. Drawing on case study analysis of organised crime in Asia, metaphorical and substantive references to its interdisciplinary dimension will be highlighted on five levels of observation: the individual “organised criminal”, the activities these individuals are involved in, the associational patterns through which they are connected, the power structures that subordinate these individuals and collectives to common or particular interests, and the relations between these individuals, structures and activities on the one hand, and the legal spheres of society on the other. Subsequently, the course will highlight the advantages and critique the limitations of a multidisciplinary analysis of organised crime in Asia. In general, the study of organised crime has profited from an multidisciplinary approach. In these cases, concepts and theories have been adopted either on the assumption that organised crime is a facet of a larger phenomenon under investigation in other disciplines, or on the assumption that sufficient similarities exist between organised crime and the objects of study of other disciplines in order to permit the drawing of analogies. However, it is equally important to address the caveat that unless the borrowing of eclectic oncepts and theories from a variety of academic disciplines is strategically done to build up a cumulative body of knowledge, efforts to conceptualise, theorise, and police the complex phenomenon of organised crime in Asia will be compromised rather than facilitated."

Many populations and governments feel they are unable to cope with the size of this playing field. People feel insecure and governments respond with populist inward-looking nationalism. However, we are individuals in societies. We cannot get away from living with people whose cultures and values we do not understand. Even if we bury our heads in the sand, the globalized world will not go away, for it is a fact of modern times. All of us will have to deal with people from diverse cultures in order to work and live successfully today.\n\nThis course gives insight into the thinking of communities other than our own. Religion is a primal response of man. Religion moves people beyond the rational to the transcendental and engenders such strong feelings people will go to war, and are willing to die for their faiths. Asia is the frontier of future economic development. It is crucial to know Asian society and culture for encounters with Asia can only increase."

        "institution": "SMU",
        "description": "This new course is a response to the increasing use of drone technology and 3D robotics in business and society. Drones are unmanned, multi-purpose tools. Their history can be traced back to World War  I  when  the  US  army  experimented  with  unmanned  aerial  torpedoes.  Nowadays, drone technology belongs to the military arsenal of many nations.  Drones serve many purposes (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance etc.), and they can be deadly. In business and society, drones are utilised to capture images of people and/or buildings, to monitor agricultural conditions, to take pictures from (or of) hard to reach places, to assess the impact of climate change on rainforests, to film events, to deliver parcels, to survey real estate, to deliver help to heart attack victims in remote areas via a flying defibrillator or to fly life-saving kits to swimmers in emergency situations. In view of their increasing importance in terms of commercial value creation, R&D (it is estimated that about $6.4 billion is spent annually for R&D on drones), job creation, innovation (e.g. Internet of Things), new forms of warfare as well as legal/moral-ethical/regulatory concerns, it is imperative that students learn to critically appreciate the multiple and often conflicting implications and consequences of this technology for business and society. To achieve that, students will have to read widely and familiarize themselves with the various drone functionalities in order to critically assess drone technology and to articulate informed opinions about ‘the good’, ‘the bad’, and ‘the future’ of unmanned aerial vehicles. The course will be taught by a multi-disciplinary team of instructors from three different SMU schools (LKCSB, SIS and SOL)  plus exposure to drone entrepreneurs  and  first-hand,  team-based  experiences  in  piloting  mini drones  within  the SMU campus."

In Singapore, this will refer to an older adult between 65 and 80+ years old. The Third Age offers opportunities and possibilities for a life of purpose and significance.\nThis Capstone course challenges students to apply knowledge and skills in their discipline to tackle the psychological, sociological, economics, and management challenges of a rapidly ageing society. It is a unique learning opportunity that emphasize the application of academic knowledge accumulated in prior core courses to solving real world problems. The course develops in students an ability to identify problems and develop solutions by analytic review and abstract idea generation. To achieve this, the capstone will simulate the “real world” through the development/implementation of innovative solutions to real client projects. Students will have the opportunity to assist industry partners make a positive impact in their efforts to engage the third agers in Singapore.\nClassroom sessions and SMU-X project will lead students to dive deeper into disciplines like gerontology (in particular, life span development framework of Third Age), social sciences (intergenerational), organizational behavior (diverse workplace), business management strategies (silver industry), economics, artificial intelligence & technology (in particular, elder-technology) related to the ageing population in Singapore.\nThe course will proceed by envisaging different aspects of ageing and society through published works on life in the Third Age including books, academic journal articles, case studies. Students will be working with our SMU-X industry partner, The Lien Foundation on their projects in the ageing space. Projects include the design of community space for older adults at the National Museum, and other initiatives to support Aging in Place at Yishun Community Hospital."

        "description": "“You do what you measure.” “What you can measure you can manage.” “If you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it.” “You are what you measure.”\n\nAll these variations on the standard business mantra are titles of articles that then explain why the mantra is wrong, or at best incomplete.  Measuring anything requires us to put numbers on it, or at least somehow to define what it is that we are measuring.  Sometimes such quantification clarifies our thinking, shows us what impact we are actually having, provides feedback that helps us improve what we are doing, and enables accountability to stakeholders who are affected by our actions.  Sometimes it fixates us on things that don’t matter rather than those that do, or pushes us in the wrong direction as we strive to look good according to badly designed metrics.\n\nThe metrics to assess sustainability and partnerships are still at best in development. As organizations in all three sectors experience a major push for enhancing social and environmental sustain-ability, often by means of cross-sector partnerships, a plethora of standards, metrics, and reporting requirements are emerging that purport to enable appropriate measurement and accountability.  But there is little agreement on what sustainability means, how to achieve it, or how to measure our behavior relative to sustainability standards: i.e., to know whether a given action is moving us in the right – or wrong – direction.  There is even less agreement on how to measure the contribution of cross-sector collaborations.\n\nPrevious MTSC courses have addressed the world’s major challenges and various approaches to understanding and managing them. In this module, we extend this to focus on how sustainability can be defined in actionable terms, looking at concepts of financial, social, and natural capital. We then investigate the leading experiments in measuring sustainability performance and partnership performance, building on our previous discussions of accountability.  \n\nThroughout the module, we focus on a set of questions that policymakers and practitioners are currently grappling with around the world.  \n\n• Can the Sustainable Development Goals and/or concepts such as natural and social capital and/or Planetary Boundaries provide effective markers against which to evaluate organiza-tional and system behavior and outcomes? \n\n• Do we have the data needed to know whether we are crossing planetary boundaries or achieving the SDGs and other global goals?\n\n• Do the various metrics and evaluation systems give us useful information? To whom is it useful?\n \n• Under what conditions do reporting requirements and investment indices shape organiza-tions’ behavior, and in what directions?\n \n• What do we know about the impact of cross-sector collaboration, as opposed to other approaches to large-scale problem-solving and systems change?"

        "description": "In the first half of the MTSC, the entire cohort of MTSC students considers a set of candidate policy issues that seem to require cross-sector collaboration to be effectively addressed. By the end of the IDIS 601 session (Scenarios and Futures Technologies), the cohort selects a number of topics for the Policy Task Forces, self-selecting themselves into groups for each topic.\n\nDuring each subsequent module, time is set aside for the cohort to work on the policy task force. The cohort self-organizes (in close consultation with the instructor and other team members), selecting a set of sub-themes to investigate, identifying relevant stakeholders and potential participants in a cross-sector collaboration, and drawing upon all the knowledge and skills learned in the MTSC to take the initial steps toward the creation of an effective cross-sector collaboration."

        "description": "Disciplines within the social sciences have given analytical primacy to either the environment (sociology, for instance) or the agent (psychology, for instance) or the interaction (the rational choice school within economics, for instance). As such, the disciplinarily – limited study of social science provides an incomplete understanding of social action. Interdisciplinary work within the social sciences is an attempt to redress this flaw. Interdisciplinary social science then can be defined, equally pithily, as the integrated study of social action. This course is designed to introduce you to the nature and modes of, the steps involved in and the integrative frameworks for pursuing interdisciplinary social science.\n\nThe course is divided into three relatively self-contained units. The first unit (seminars 1-5) explores the nature and purpose of knowledge in the social sciences and, in this context, discusses the epistemic goals and the methodological individualism of the different disciplines within the social sciences. The second unit (seminars 6-8) presents several extant sites of interdisciplinary cooperation within the social sciences. The third unit (seminars 9-12) prepares you for engaging in interdisciplinary research; it introduces the different modes of interdisciplinary research and the tasks associated with such research, builds rudimentary familiarity with data-based reasoning, and concludes the course by providing practical advice on implementing an interdisciplinary research project."

The primary objective of this course is to empower students to critically engage with research findings across multiple disciplines by understanding the methods used, their strengths and limitations, and whether said methods have been used correctly. To do so, students will begin by interrogating the ‘objectivity’ of scientific evidence. Students will then be introduced (intuitively) to three fundamental statistical approaches: hypothesis testing, linear regression, and experimental methods. The use of these three fundamental approaches will be critiqued by examining how statistics are often done wrong and replicating existing studies. The second part of the course will highlight the interdisciplinarity of research methods and showcase the main research methods used in economics, politics, geography, and the behavioural sciences, with a focus on understanding the strengths and limitations of different research approaches and methods. The course will conclude with sessions focusing on fieldwork and research ethics."

Through scholarship drawn from the fields of urban studies, geography, and anthropology, students will grapple with the challenge of developing urban theory adequate to the variation in metropolitan trajectories and configurations across the continent. Each class session will use a different element of the urban built environment – including roads, parks, ports, malls, and gated communities – to orient considerations of how planning, policy, and praxis contribute to the production of recognizably urban places. We will approach these material elements of the urban fabric as dynamic rather than static, examining the diverse ways in which people imagine, make, inhabit, use, contest, and remember particular sites and spaces. We will also explore how the built environment mediates a range of pressing challenges faced by contemporary Asian cities, including global climate change, rising inequality, rapid expansion, and political exclusion."

It serves as an introduction to the historical field and the methodologies used to understand past disaster, explicitly showing how studying past disaster gives us a lens into the intricate workings of social, economic, and political functioning of disaster management but also society as a whole, revealing entrenched features of society – such as vulnerability – that leave a society less able to cope. Such situations turn hazards into disasters. The historical lens therefore leads researchers into a deep study of systematic spatiotemporal socio-political functioning, showing how modern disasters are shaped by endemic and profoundly ingrained disparities and dysfunctionality in contemporary organisations, structures, and frameworks for managing society and disaster."

        "institution": "SMU",
        "description": "For the past ten years at least, the idea of the smart city has become a guiding logic for urban development throughout the world. Urban environments are increasingly sensed environments, which has led to the creation of vast volumes of data, the leveraging of which can create value for an array of public, private and people stakeholders. As a heuristic that captures these processes of sensing, creating and leveraging data, smart cities are meant to be more responsive, adaptive, predictive, and potentially liveable and sustainable than their “non-smart” antecedents. However, in the pursuit of “smartness”, so too must critical questions be asked about the neoliberalisation of the urban commons, the importance of civic participation, and the potential for smartness to create new forms of division, inequality and inequity in our cities.\n\nWith this in mind, this course foregrounds the uniquenesses of Asian cities to better understand the uneven global geography of the smart city paradigm. In doing so, it considers what defines a “smart” city, and how Asian cities might be considered as theoretically distinct from their non-Asian counterparts. It also explores the role of the Asian developmental state, of centralised planning and policy regimes, and of urban informality on the translation of smart city policy visions to on-the-ground urban realities. Through these considerations and explorations, the course seeks to appreciate different ways of thinking about Asian smart cities, how they might be different from their non-Asian counterparts, and how they might reveal new, and perhaps more aspirational visions of urban futurity in Asia and beyond."

This history is a lens into how our modern environmental and climatic concerns have developed as result of long-held trajectories and entrenched ways of being, often in the name of ‘economic development’ as well as exploitation. By looking at the colonial era in these two countries the course enables insight into how political and economic development have been tied to uneven power structures, many of which still endure. The course looks at urban development as well as the process of land-use change in the countries more broadly, connecting changes such as population growth to broader environmental and socio-political and economic issues. It also explores the origins of environmental thought, as a direct product of the stark and rapid changes wrought by ‘progress’. As the eminent environmental historian Richard Grove once said, colonialism is a lens through which broad and long-term patterns of environmental changes (and their catalysts) can be analysed in microcosm."

In this context, the course introduces students to large-scale, real-world supply chain processes and their key operational choices and managerial decisions. Taking business-centered rather than technology-centered perspectives, students are introduced to SCM software applications and relevant technologies. We explore strategic opportunities and practical challenges of their applications in global operations. The main focus, taking a supply chain IT user’s perspective, remains on discovering business requirements and operational constraints, and understanding how to lever the applicable technologies surveyed. Beyond the typical shipper’s logistics and supply chain integration project management concerns, selected special industry topics will be examined: third-party logistics, continental trucking, global freight shipping, logistic depot and seaport terminal operations.\n\nObjectives\nUpon completing the course, students will\n• Understand key logistics and supply chain concepts and strategies, and the role IT plays to help reduce cost and provide strategic advantages.\n• Know the range of information and communication technologies that supports SCM and understand how they may be employed.\n• Understand the complexity in the integration of supply chain activities, as well as the integration of disparate technologies deployed to support the challenges in physical coordination.\n\nPre-requisite: None (For 3rd or 4th year students only)"

        "description": "We interact with a variety of services and systems in our daily lives. While manual labors still take some part in those systems, some other parts become more and more automated by artificial intelligence (AI). In general, we might expect that those systems treat users fairly. If the system uses AI that is built on big data and complex algorithms, such expectation would be strengthened. Compared to human labor that might involve subjective decision-making, algorithmic systems are expected to objectively work and treat users fairly. However, in recent years, there are raising concerns about the potential harms of those systems, which are rooted in biases embedded in socio-technical systems. The inherent opaque nature of AI systems makes the problem worse.\nFor example, YouTube recommends next videos when a video is finished playing. Those recommendations, on the one hand, are helpful to find interesting videos from a tremendous number of YouTube videos, but on the other hand, it is often unclear how or why the video is recommended. What happens if some biases exist in the recommendation algorithm, such as favoring videos with a specific (political) view? No matter whether those biases are intentional or unintentional, users would be exposed to a certain set of videos and are likely to be influenced by them. \nYouTube is only one out of many examples because AI systems are becoming pervasive these days. In various areas, including healthcare, hiring, financial service, ads, policymaking, and internet services, AI systems are actively used. Thus, it is crucial to ensure that those systems are working fairly without any potential biases. It might be overlooked that the biases are embedded not only in the AI systems but also in established processes or human operators within the systems.\nThe goal of this course is to provide students with an extensive understanding of diverse concepts of fairness and bias in socio-technical systems through examples across diverse domains, from healthcare to internet search. Then, students will learn how to audit practical systems in terms of fairness and bias through recent case studies. The course also aims to understand public concerns related to AI systems and help students to deeply think about ethical AI within multiple social contexts."

        "institution": "SMU",
        "description": "In a world where digital technologies are not just tools but extensions of our daily lives, their societal impacts are far-reaching yet still emerging. Past slogans like \"move fast and break things\" led tech companies to overlook harms, as evidenced by scandals involving user data misuse and workplace culture issues.\n\nThere is now broader recognition that responsible innovation requires understanding potential risks and aligning with human values. But how can we ensure that technology advances in a manner that's ethical, sustainable, and beneficial for all?\n\nThis timely course explores ethics in computing. Through case studies and frameworks, students will develop skills in critical and nuanced thinking about complex issues at the intersection of technology and society.\n\nWhat you will find in this course:\n- Embracing Complexity: We won't seek single \"right\" answers. Instead, we'll foster a space for exploring multidimensional problems with interconnected tradeoffs, encouraging students to understand, appreciate, and engage with differing viewpoints.\n- Skill Development: Students will practise not just theory but systematic analysis of real-world impacts, preparing them for the consequential decisions they may face in their future careers.\n- Structured Exploration: The course is divided into two engaging parts. The first introduces fundamental concepts, while the second dives into contemporary dilemmas, exposing the tensions between responsible development and disruptive innovation.\n- Respectful Discourse: A commitment to respectful dialogue is central to this course. We recognise the intricate and \"messy\" nature of real-world problems, with ramifications extending far into a dynamic and uncertain technological future.\n- Distinct Focus on Technology: While courses like \"COR3301 Ethics and Social Responsibility\" provide a broad understanding of ethical conduct across various professions, this course specialises in the intersection of technology and ethics. This course targets the unique challenges of the digital age, equipping tech professionals with the nuanced understanding needed to navigate ethical dilemmas specific to computing, AI, and digital human rights. It's a tailored exploration for those aiming to align technological advancements with responsible decision-making.\n- Empowering Future Leaders: By attuning students to ethical imperatives and responsible decision-making processes, this course prepares the next generation of tech professionals to navigate and guide technological progress in a manner that honours human values and serves the greater good."

When banks misprice risk associated with financial products or take on too much risk, they endanger their overall profitability. Likewise, when legal and regulatory compliance  are mismanaged, banks can incur substantial fines, suffer reputational damage, and become subject to ongoing regulatory scrutiny. Accordingly, efficient and effective management of risk and regulatory compliance is a core focus for banks' management. Because of its mathematical nature, risk calculation, extensively leveraged technology for several decades. On the other hand, a long-standing approach that banks have used to deal with gaps in regulatory compliance and increasing regulation has been to \"throw more bodies\" at the problem.  This approach has been costly, inefficient, and, in some cases, ineffective.  As a result, Regtech solutions have been developed that help banks use technology to address compliance-related challenges.\n\nThis course begins by providing an introduction to Risktech, technology that is used to support banks' risk management activities.  It reviews the main types of risks that banks encounter: market risk, credit risk, and operational risk and the processes and techniques used to measure those risks. Challenges related to managing risk data and performing risk calculations are reviewed along with related technology approaches.  The course then goes on to review the purpose and application of bank regulation and common causes of regulatory compliance failure.

        "description": "Many companies are moving towards digital transformation today. Most processes are being supported by systems with certain degree of automation. For example, an order-to-cash process may involve receiving orders on the eCommerce platform. Orders are then routed to supply chain for fulfilment. Multiple steps of approvals may be required to fulfil an order, followed by arrangement of shipments to the customers. Invoices are also digitally captured, and payment received via various online means. In the real-world businesses, processes are highly complex, dynamic (evolving over time) and uncertain (subject to random events and behaviours).\n\nProcess analytics is a field of analytics that includes understanding the business processes in an organization, analysing process performances, evaluating the resources consumed and developing improved ones that help organizations operate more efficiently and effectively.  Based on this key principle, this course covers two major topics -- Process Mining and Process Simulation. \n\nProcess Mining is a technique to discover processes and characterise them in process models. Graph modeling and machine learning algorithms are applied to discover business processes from the event execution data. This data-driven technique can provide the ground truth (of the actual execution) rather than relying on an idealized process model. It can also identify the bottlenecks and opportunities for improving the processes. From the process models, we combine the ground truth and expert’s view to design the new to-be processes. As the real-world process are typically challenging to be modelled mathematically, simulation becomes the only feasible tool to examine the alternatives. By incorporating the data models from the actual process execution, process simulation helps decision-makers to arrive at evidence-based conclusions by visualizing, analysing and optimizing their processes.\n\nThis course covers the Descriptive, Predictive and Prescriptive analytics by modeling and simulating the behaviour of real-world business processes. You will be introduced to both the theoretical background and applications of process mining and simulation. Topics covered include data mining the process events, applying machine learning methods to derive the processes, abstracting real-world process as a digital replica, statistical analysis of the simulation models and introductory concepts of digital twin. The skills and competencies you learned will be applicable to various industries such as manufacturing, retail, healthcare, and many more."

        "description": "In the information age, the production and management of data will define the future of governance and businesses. The ‘data economy’ renders digitized information - promulgating at ever increasing speed – a valuable asset through the use of data analytics. It has also led to a fundamental shift in power and markets. The emergence of disruptive technological and business innovations is one prominent example of such a change. New economies are formed, such as from the use of artificial intelligence (AI), the development of ‘cognitive services’, the digitization of goods and the provision of storage/sharing and management services. Governments, including the Singapore public sector, are also aware of the importance of data to governance and to the future of the economy and are driving innovations and technology usage within that sector as well as in society generally through the Smart Nation initiative and Digital Economy drive. Substantial research and development are also encouraged in this field.\n\nThese fundamental shifts also lead to many problems and challenges related to different types of data and data sets. For Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) and the data economy generally, cybersecurity is a major concern. In relation to personal data and digital communications, there are various threats to different forms of privacy. Other current issues surrounding data are the ‘fake news’ phenomenon and the persistent threats to intellectual property. On the flipside, these developments have also led to new industries (and careers) such as in the areas of cybersecurity and data protection.\n\nThe objective of this course is to prepare students who are interested in data protection law and may have an interest in making a career in this nascent industry that is set to grow. Students will first be introduced to the data economy as a concept and to the real changes to the market and to society as well as the various forms and categorisations of data and the legal aspects to these data sets. The second part of the course will then focus on privacy law and its relationship with data protection (DP) law. In this context, comparative study will be made of privacy and DP regimes of significance (e.g. OECD, EU, APEC, etc.). Third, students will then focus their study on the Singapore Personal Data Protection Act (and other relevant laws) – in particular, the data protection and do not call provisions - by looking at its history, objective, scope/application and possible future developments e.g. Data Protection Ecosystem and PDPA Act Review. Comparative study of similar concepts and processes in other jurisdictions will also be assessed in the course of the study of the Singapore PDPA. The fundamental concepts and workings of the PDPA will be examined in depth. In the fourth part of the course, practitioners from the PDPC and the private sector will provide their perspectives on this process and a holistic and practical viewpoint to the study. \n\nAfter completing this course, students will be able to use what they have learnt to obtain professional certification such as from the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) and PDPC with a view to practice in this area as a privacy counsel, privacy professional, manager and/or technologist. This will prepare students for a career in this growing field, or at least provide them with the skills and knowledge when dealing with such issues as a TMT lawyer, legal counsel or even as a general legal practitioner that will possibly encounter these issues at work."

The issues are selected based on their topicality, feedback from industry, importance to Singapore and ASEAN and a review of academic and business literature.\n\nStudents will be guided in an exploration and analysis of cross-border trade law issues relating to the intersection of commerce and technology. In the first part of the course, an explanation of the some key issues will be provided to help students understand the broader context of trade in the digital economy. Students will then be exposed to a number of issues which are confronting policy-makers and the private sector, so that they may conduct legal research and craft clear and cogent law and policy recommendations from their findings. Industry professionals will help to provide feedback and discuss students’ findings and recommendations. Industry contacts in this course are likely to be from the fields of finance, technology, commerce, policy/strategy and law.\n\nIn addition to interactive learning with the course instructor (Professor Locknie Hsu), students will also receive industry and policy insights from 1-3 industry experts (who may be from the commerce and finance, technology and/or policy-making sectors)."

It will start with a detailed discussion of the general theory of IP laws and try to establish common principles applicable to all areas of IP. It will then introduce the competition law regimes on cartel, abuse of dominance and unfair competition, before it embarks on to examine  compulsory license of IP, exhaustion of IP,  resale price maintenance agreement  on IP protected protects, and the issuance of warning letters, which encompass all IP laws. The module will further break down to analyze the relationship between competition law and the exercise of specific IP rights, such as patents, copyrights, trademarks, design rights, plant variety rights, and eventually also  trade secrets."

When problems arise in the relationship or transaction and the parties seek to resolve their disputes, the conflict of laws addresses four large issues: (1) when will a Singapore court exercise jurisdiction to adjudicate? (2) What can a Singapore court be asked to do to prevent a foreign court from adjudicating? (3) When will a Singapore court apply something other than the domestic law of Singapore to determine the claim? And (4) what effect will a foreign judgment have in Singapore? Given the cross-border nature of the issues, the position in other jurisdictions (for example, the applicable rules in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States) will also be considered for the purposes of comparison with Singapore law."

        "description": "More than ¼ of the world’s population is Muslim, including roughly 195 million Muslims in Indonesia, 16 million Muslims in Malaysia, and 439 million Muslims in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Increasingly important in the commercial life of even purely secular countries, Islamic finance world-wide is enjoying an annual growth rate estimated conservatively between 15–20% (assets under management by Islamic financial institutions are estimated to be growing annually as much as 25% and even 40% in some locations). Islamic law has long been overlooked in traditional legal curricula yet it is increasingly important for practicing lawyers to have a basic familiarity with its commercial concepts, as a complement to common law and civil code systems. This subject is an introduction for law students to the primary sources of Islamic law (Sharī‘ah), Islamic commercial jurisprudence (fiqh al-mu‘āmalah), and jurisprudential methodology in Islam (usūl al-fiqh); legal interpretation and analysis through the methodology of ijtihād, and concepts of qiyās, ‘illah, istihsān, and maslāhah; Islamic law of contracts, including sales contracts (e.g. bai‘ al-salam, bai‘ al-inah, bai‘ al-istisnā‘) and partnerships used in commercial transactions (mudārabah and mushārakah); and the Islamic waqf."

Banks as providers of deposit and savings accounts, payment mechanisms, and finance are crucial to all sectors of commerce. A significant sector of the legal profession provides advice to the banking industry and this course will be helpful to those seeking to work in that sector.\n \nThe initial part of the course will focus upon the duties and obligations of banks and their customers, in particular, in respect of payment methods. In this context there will be an analysis of those legal principles which enable a bank (or its customer) to recover mistaken payments, as well as an examination of the bank's liability for the fraudulent activities of third parties. More generally, there will be a consideration of the bank’s responsibility as a fiduciary and its duty of confidentiality to its customer.\n\nThe second part of the course will then be devoted to the pivotal role of the bank as a finance provider. There will be a consideration of different types of loan, together with legal mechanisms that are available, or may be utilised, to secure their repayment  (for example, guarantees, set-offs, security over receivables and liens). Particular emphasis will be placed on problems of drafting. Attention will also be given to the bank's role in financing international trade through performance bonds and letters of credit."

Laws alone are manifestly inadequate in maintaining peace on hot-button issues of race, language, and religion. The course will also examine the political framework in place that complements the legal and policy infrastructure.

In those contexts, the substantive policies and principles of the law will be addressed – e.g. , the pari passu principle, the concept of set-off, and the avoidance of suspect transactions entered in the run-up to insolvency. In addition, the course will consider informal debt restructurings (work-outs), and also introduce the issues and developing law relating to cross-border insolvencies. As well as providing a theoretical grounding in corporate insolvency principles, it is expected that aspects of the course will involve the participation of specialist insolvency lawyers from private practice, with the aim of providing a practical perspective. \nAlthough the primary focus will be on corporate insolvency, comparison will be made with the procedures and rules applicable in the bankruptcy of individuals.

The materials that will be analyzed in the course will be the BITs and the investment protection chapters in the FTAs concluded by Singapore, a few principal model BITs issued by countries such as the US, some typical foreign investment protection laws of some ASEAN countries and the decisional law of investment dispute tribunals such as the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)."

Instead it would choose to engage in a joint venture which can control the knowledge through the joint venture vehicle of which the source firm is a participant.  The surge in collaborative ventures may also be driven by considerations of access to markets, access to capital, seeking benefits from economies of scale, a syndication of risk, or access to local organizational capabilities and positional assets such as distribution outlets.\n\nFor Singapore based firms venturing abroad, Indonesia offers many low hanging fruits.  An abundance of natural resources, the largest population and the largest market in ASEAN, and a dynamic economy attract overseas business in ASEAN. Often going it alone in Indonesia is not an option for various reasons.\n\nA student who successfully completes the course would have a clear understanding of the common law on joint ventures, would understand the differences between Indonesian company law and Singapore law insofar as these are material in negotiating and documenting a corporate joint venture, be able to analyze significant clauses in a joint venture agreement, and provide for successful termination and dispute resolution."

With increasing globalization, international trade, and international contracting, the number of international arbitration disputes has steadily increased--especially in Singapore, which has become a major arbitration hub. Many Singapore and international law firms have arbitration teams in Singapore—many more will form these teams in the near future to take advantage of the steady upward trend in the volume of casework in the region. Arbitration work is by definition international, peripatetic, multi-lingual, multi-cultural and spans all industries that make up international business. No two cases are the same. It is a challenging field that attracts talented lawyers from all over the world. It is an exciting time to be an arbitration lawyer in Singapore.\n\nThis course provides a rigorous “hands-on” practical introduction to International Arbitration with a focus on experiential learning. The aim of the course is to prepare the student to practice in the field of international arbitration. The method of instruction is through lectures, workshops, and practical written and oral exercises. The course is a “learn by doing” academy on an arbitration case from start to finish.  We will utilize a case study as the vehicle through which students will be exposed to advising a client on all stages of the dispute resolution process, from selecting the appropriate dispute resolution mechanism and drafting the dispute resolution clause, steps and strategies to take when a dispute arises, to working through all phases of the arbitration process till award, and post-award proceedings in courts."

To set the scene there will be a consideration of freedom of speech and expression and, in particular, press freedom as a constitutional concept; and how these should be balanced against countervailing public interests such as protection of privacy, reputation, and confidence in the administration of justice. This will be followed by an examination of the following topics: how the print and broadcast media (including the Internet) are regulated; defamation law as it relates to the media, particularly the public figure and responsible journalism defences; criminal offences such as contempt of court, criminal defamation and sedition that restrict the publication of certain types of content; conflict of laws and criminal extraterritoriality issues arising when material from abroad can be accessed in Singapore; and the efficacy of self-regulation in the media industry. A number of these issues will be illuminated by examining key court judgments such as Review Publishing v Lee Hsien Loong [2010] 1 SLR 52, CA, and Shadrake v Attorney-General [2011] 3 SLR 778, CA; and legislation such as the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act (Cap 206, 2002 Rev Ed) and the Broadcasting (Class Licence) (Amendment) Notification 2013 (S 330/2013). In addition, to provide a cross-border perspective on the subject, comparisons will be made between the law in Singapore and a legal regime that is more restrictive (possibly China) and one that is more liberal (probably the United Kingdom), where possible."

The growth of international trade has given rise to a corresponding increase in the number of transnational commercial disputes. Commercial parties desire a swift, practical and cost-effective resolution of such disputes. National legal systems were designed primarily to manage intra-jurisdictional disputes and were perhaps not particularly well-equipped to deal with cross-border disputes. \n\nInternational arbitration has provided a big part of the answer and serves as a primary if not default means of resolving transnational commercial disputes today. More recently, the courts in a number of jurisdictions have also innovated to fit into the changed dispute resolution landscape. They have established specialized international commercial courts such as in Dubai, and most recently, in Singapore as viable alternatives to international arbitration, depending on the parties’ particular needs. \n\nAny student with interest in pursuing a career in international commercial dispute resolution needs to have a good grasp of the process of the creation of commercial law and how they are enforced through various dispute resolution mechanisms.  The objectives of the course are to equip students with a working knowledge of the Singapore International Commercial Court, as well as prepare students to practise in the field of international arbitration. Course content is roughly divided equally between international commercial dispute resolution and international arbitration. \n\nThe part of the course on international arbitration will be focused on practical aspects of international arbitration procedure. It will be a “learn by doing” academy which may revolve around a case study as the vehicle through which students will be exposed to some of the more significant stages of the dispute resolution process. \n\nSome knowledge of the basics of international commercial arbitration and commercial conflict of laws would be complementary though not necessary."

Courts have increasingly had to contend with these cross-border issues. As the activities of corporations often transcend national frontiers and the consequences of such activities can be felt in a great number of States, there is increasing awareness that some form of supranational regulation of corporations is necessary in certain areas such as the protection of human rights and the environment and the fight against corruption. \n\nDuring the same period, business and human rights has emerged as a distinct field. The United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (2011), for example, define a corporate responsibility to respect human rights. In response to growing pressure to address human rights issues, some transnational companies have begun to conduct human rights due diligence and integrate human rights considerations in corporate policies and practices. \n\nDrawing on international standards, industry case studies, legal proceedings, the work of international organizations, and a growing academic literature, course explores the theoretical difficulties in securing corporate responsibility for human rights abuses within the framework of transnational law; as well as the practical aspects of enforcing such responsibility in international and national courts and tribunals, with a particular focus on the Southeast Asian region. "

We will adopt a topical approach, where students explore different areas of the law and psychology’s relevance to them each week. A sampling of the issues we will cover include:\n\n•  mental disorders and their implications for offending behaviour and criminal procedure\n•  human memory and its effects on eyewitness and courtroom testimony;\n•  custody evaluations and psychological assessment in family law proceedings;\n•  behaviourial theories underlying principles in tort and evidence law; and\n•  how lawyering skills such as negotiation, persuasion and advocacy can be enhanced and informed by psychological research.\n\nThis course seeks to develop better practitioners for the future by giving fledgling lawyers the psychological lens they may require to make sense of practical issues that commonly arise in practice.

To that end, the ASEAN experience will be examined by combining a macro- and micro-perspective. The course will invite students to evaluate the path that ASEAN has followed so far and contrast this with the choices that have been made in other regions; inquire into ASEAN’s relationship with non-member states and other international organizations; and critically reflect on how future challenges ought to be tackled. At the same time, considerable attention will be devoted to the actual rules and policies geared towards delivering ASEAN’s objectives – with those pertaining to the ASEAN Economic Community taking centre stage in this regard – and the institutions and processes that make possible the adoption and execution of these substantive norms. \n\nThis course aims to equip students with foundational knowledge about ASEAN rules, policies and procedures so that they can confidently tackle the ASEAN-dimension of cross-border questions awaiting them in their legal careers – be it in legal practice, as in-house counsel or working for the Singapore government."

Students will be expected to critically examine the regulatory environment; the law and the policy operating behind the law; and the role of the different stakeholders in addressing criminal offences committed in the financial sector. Students will hopefully appreciate the balance required in upholding the rule of law while maintaining Singapore’s reputation as a business-friendly, yet well regulated, international financial centre."

Students will then be introduced to some of the major legal questions of our time, for example the treatment of Taliban and Al Qaeda members at Guantanamo Bay and the entitlement to prisoner-of-war status by members of Islamic State (Da’esh). We shall also explore how public international law deals with the issue of nuclear weapons, taking the atomic attacks of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 as our lead examples, as well as the choice of targets (i.e. the increased destruction of hospitals in the Syrian conflict, as shown in The New Barbarianism). There shall be a strong reliance on actual examples of warfare—from Vietnam, to the destruction of cultural property such as the Buddas of Bamiyan of Afghanistan, through the justice for ‘comfort women’ or sexual slaves who suffered at the hands of Japan at the end of the Second World War to the belligerent occupation of Iraq—to explain the basic tenets of and strengths of the law but also the unique problems by trying to introduce order into chaos."

It will be shown that, even though most insolvency jurisdictions seek to solve similar economic problems, the way to do so differs across jurisdictions. After becoming familiar with the insolvency regime existing in some relevant jurisdictions, we will analyse which factors and insolvency provisions may help create an optimal insolvency regime. In order to do so, we will take into account the economic problems that insolvency law seeks to solve, the particular features of a country, and the impact that the solutions provided by insolvency legislators may have on entrepreneurship, innovation, and access to finance. It will be shown that insolvency law is a very powerful tool to promote growth in a country. For this reason, linked to the fact that many jurisdictions want to become global centres for corporate restructurings, several countries around the globe are amending their insolvency laws. Among other proposals, we will analyse those existing in the United States and Europe, and which steps are being taken by Singapore to become a global leader for corporate reorganizations. The course will conclude with an analysis of the primary problems, challenges and solutions to deal with cross-border insolvency. For that purpose, we will analyse the features of the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross Border Insolvency, as well as some regional initiatives - such as the European Insolvency Regulation- to deal with those problems arising in a situation of insolvency in which there is an international component."

The State Courts – NUS & SMU Clerkship Programme (“the Clerkship Programme”) is a judicial clinical programme designed to provide top law students with the opportunity to be attached to senior District Court Judges (“Supervising Judges”) and acquire experiential knowledge of law practice through direct exposure to judicial work. It is a unique course which allows law students to acquire a different perspective of legal work through personalised interaction with senior Judges, working on actual cases and experiencing legal practice in real-life settings.\n\n2. In the course of the Clerkship Programme, the Clerks will be required to assist Judges with legal research and case analysis in cases involving more complex legal issues. The Clerks will experience the realities of court proceedings from observing court hearings and interacting with the Judges. From the vantage point of the decision-maker, the Clerks will get to experience first-hand the adjudication process of receiving and weighing relevant facts and evidence, assessing the credibility of witnesses, and persuasion by opposing parties.\n\n3. The Clerkship Programme will allow Clerks to practise and consolidate legal skills already acquired under the core curriculum through case research, writing and analysis. Through exposure to court litigation, the Clerks will be able to hone higher cognitive legal skills through critical analysis of facts, evidence, legal arguments and persuasion, as well as to gain a unique understanding of the critical processes in fact-finding and decision-making from a judicial perspective. Through interaction with Judges and other legal professionals, such as lawyers and court staff, the Clerk will learn higher level professional skills in communication and court craft, which are critical in their future careers as lawyers. The clerkship training will allow Clerks to learn the intricacies of various processes and rules in the context of judicial administration and engage in self-learning of substantive areas of law across disciplines.\n\n4. As the Clerkship Programme is intended to prepare the Clerks for life as a legal professional and takes place in a real world setting where court schedules are subject to change and other exigencies, the learning experience can be expected to be a rich and varied one. As Supervising Judges are engaged in their own professional work, the range of support that the Clerks can provide can vary depending on the types of cases that come before the Judges.\n\n5. All Clerks must be prepared to take ownership of their own learning and time management by capitalising on opportunities for learning, discussion and reflection. Clerks are required to find opportunities to complete the list of minimum tasks listed in paragraph 14 of this syllabus, and are encouraged to add to the list as the opportunity arises."

They will then write two short legal commentaries, which will require both research and analysis. The commentaries will involve topics of practical significance, analysis of which would be helpful to practitioners and/or the general public. These topics will include (but are not limited to) those identified by ALN.\n\nAs part of the learning process, students will work in pairs: they will review and edit each other’s work (including reviewing the research and analysis conducted by their partner), and in doing so hone their own analytical and writing skills. Students will also focus on communicating their analysis in a manner which is helpful to both lawyers and non-lawyers.\n\nStudents will receive close guidance and supervision from the instructor, including frequent feedback and in-person consultations. They will also receive practical feedback from ALN on their commentaries, including the usefulness of their research and analysis.\n\nStudents will also be able to gain insights into the legal tech industry, through discussions with ALN personnel.\n\nAt the end of the course, students will have the opportunity to submit their papers to SMU Lexicon <https://smulexicon.com> and ALN (articles may be cross-posted on both sites). This will allow their writing to reach a wider audience. This will also help students develop their body of work as they move from school into practice."

In Singapore, this is evidenced by the Government’s push for a sound and comprehensive legal framework for the promotion and protection of IP, and by the setting up of the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS) and the IP Academy. More recently, several amendments were made to Singapore’s IP legislation in order to implement the country’s obligations under the United States – Singapore Free Trade Agreement.\n\nYou will, in this course, be introduced to the different types of IP rights and the various branches of IP law, in particular the law of copyright, patents and trademarks. Apart from learning the fundamental principles of IP law and the impact of international IP conventions and treaties, we will have the opportunity to explore, from a comparative perspective, the various policy issues which underpin much of the IP debate – in particular, controversies surrounding the protection, exploitation and enforcement of IP rights. Through group project work and presentations, we shall also examine how the IP regime operates in appropriate Asian jurisdictions and assess whether the protection and enforcement mechanisms in these jurisdictions measure up to international norms and standards.\n\nThe study of IP was, until quite recently, a somewhat esoteric specialisation. Today, IP occupies a central position in the global, knowledge-based economy and this course should therefore appeal to those who wish to equip themselves with knowledge of a burgeoning and highly relevant area of the law."

Entities whose support of  the proposed foreign investment venture, such as banks, suppliers, and customers, would also need to be assured that the political risk has been reduced by situating the proposed venture in the framework of applicable foreign investment law."

The preliminary discussions and meetings, however, take place via email and video-conference with all parties in their home countries.  The mediation occurs and the parties reach a settlement, which the parties’ legal representatives draft into contractual form. Such cross-border mediations involve:\n• international and intercultural competencies;\n• online and face-to-face mediation processes and protocols; and\n• knowledge of the applicable law in relation to the substantive and procedural aspects of mediation.\n\nThis course offers you a framework for understanding cross-border mediation law and practice and the opportunity to develop specialised mediation skills relevant to cross-border settings. Simulated role-play exercises are arranged to develop your skills as a mediator.\n\nUpon successful completion of the course and related assessment, participants will be able to apply to the Singapore International Mediation Institute (SIMI) for mediator accreditation. Participants who wish to do so may inform SIDRA staff at learning@sidra.academy. SIDRA will verify the results of the assessment and refer the participant’s application to SIMI.

In this regard, commercial remedies constitute the end product of any legal dispute but is mired in great uncertainty and potential confusion. We will consider the subjects in the law of obligations that commercial remedies transcends, through a structured and comprehensive discussion of all aspects of Singapore commercial remedies, ranging from issues in contract, tort, equity and restitution. We will discuss key cases that have hitherto never been discussed in a commercial remedies context and draw the threads together on a practically relevant and commercially important area. We will also focus on relevant decisions from other Commonwealth jurisdictions, which contributes to the comparative jurisprudence and enhances its relevance to the broader, global audience. Given its comprehensive treatment of Singapore commercial remedies as well as its reference to a wide range of comparative material with a view towards an advanced understanding of the law of obligations, this course will be highly relevant not only to local practitioners and students, but also to students from other common law jurisdictions"

        "description": "The course embarks on an investigation into some prevalent ethical and legal challenges that arise out of the application of contemporary technologies in society.\n\nEarlier classes provide a brief introduction to the concept of AI and ethics. The real and hypothesized risks of AI are considered, alongside AI’s capabilities and applications across different sectors and industries. This is followed by an examination into the definition of ethics, current ethical codes and frameworks, and the role of ethics as providing a self-regulatory frame for the creation of fair, explainable, transparent, non-discriminatory AI systems.\n\nThe course then moves into an exploration of both mainstream and alternative approaches to AI ethics. Students are guided to explore ethical theories such as utilitarianism, non-consequentialism, and virtue ethics. Underrepresented perspectives on AI ethics such as vulnerability theory, posthumanism, postcolonialism theory and eco-justice are also examined. These discussions enable students to consider the theories they find most relevant and fitting for AI ethics and for managing AI systems. Additionally, by engaging and critically evaluating with these perspectives, students are encouraged to cultivate a deeper appreciation of the barriers associated with translating these ethical principles into practice.\n\nMoving on, the course is interested in the operation of AI and technology in the legal sphere. The impact, opportunities, and challenges associated with the deployment of AI in the legal sphere are traced, followed by an investigation into the emerging legal issues associated with AI applications. Questions of interest here include the responsibility and liability of AI systems, the impact of AI on individual rights and liberties, the emergence of AI-enabled crime, AI’s interference with an accused’s due process rights, and the influence of AI on Democracy and the Rule of Law. In subsequent classes, real-life case studies are cited to present the ethical issues and challenges associated with the application of AI in practice. The case studies explore themes associated with the erosion of privacy and surveillance, the determination of justice and fairness, the threat to human dignity, issues of misinformation and (dis)trust, responsible innovation, and the power and accountability of State and big tech companies.\n\nThe above determined issues are all examined in light of current legal regimes managing contemporary AI systems. Students are asked to assess the adequacy of current legal frameworks alongside limitations of AI ethical frameworks. They are led to recognise how the pace in which AI is advancing and transforming the world means that existing laws are quickly becoming outdated. The limitations associated with AI ethical frameworks would also quickly become apparent prompting the question of what next and where do we go from here?\n\nThese regulatory gaps challenge the safe use of technology opening pathways for the abuse and exploitation of new technologies. Increasing calls have been made seeking innovative regulatory models that go beyond self-regulatory or voluntary AI ethics governance frames. Yet, on the other hand, concerns surrounding how over-regulation will stifle innovation continue to emerge. In our final classes, we look at various AI governance approaches – in Asia and beyond – and explore current regulatory initiatives, as well as, more innovative regulatory frames."

The most comprehensive rules on international trade are contained in the Agreements of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which now cover issues including trade in both industrial and agricultural products, trade in services, labor mobility, investment, free trade agreements, health and food safety, and a wide variety of domestic regulatory regimes. Thus, it is important that lawyers advising business firms understand these rules so they may help the clients to structure their transactions to maximize their benefits and minimize the costs.\n\nTaught by a former staff member of the WTO Secretariat who is among a handful of people in the world who have worked on WTO cases as an insider at both the panel and Appellate Body levels, the course will help the students to study the legal rules of the WTO and free trade agreements, which cover tariff measures, antidumping and safeguard measures, food safety regulations, as well as domestic regulations of key WTO Members like the US & China.\n\nUsing real WTO cases decided by the WTO tribunals as examples, the students will be able to critically examine how these rules are made, what are the impacts on business firms, how to argue the best case for their clients, and how these rules could be improved in the future.\n\nThe knowledge and skills learnt in this course will be helpful for students to participate in various WTO moot courts around the world, and explore a wide range of career options, including private law firms, government agencies (MFA, MTI), multinational companies, and international organizations (WTO, World Bank)."

This forecasting is valuable in plotting the ethical, social, and legal ramifications of said eventualities and determining optimal regulatory oversight.\n\nMore so than other types of stories, dystopian film and television provide highly visual and memorable touchstones for society to discuss complex technological ideas. Consider the recently popular television anthology series Black Mirror, which first aired in 2011.  Many of the show’s most disturbing episodes feature seemingly futuristic technologies such as devices that wire directly into the human brain and present the potential consequences thereof. Surprisingly, such revolutionary technologies are not so far off.   A great example of this convergence is Elon Musk’s Neuralink Corp. which recently announced a similar device to the one in Black Mirror, the  pending ability of Neuralink’s implanted brain chip to allow people to “listen to music directly from our chips […or] control hormone levels and use them to our advantage.”\n\nGiven the warp speed at which fiction and non-fiction appear to be colliding, there are clear teaching opportunities in employing dystopian film and television programs in the areas of pedagogy focused on the intersection between law and technology.  \n\nThis course will look to Hollywood’s view of dystopia as a jumping off point to analyze the intersection between law and emerging technologies.   The course will focus mostly on the Black Mirror series, but will also look to other shows and film as well."

These two jurisdictions are chosen first for their economic prominence. Knowledge about the key areas of commercial laws in the two largest economies in the world will get students better prepared for cross-border transaction practices. At the same time, these two jurisdictions are also chosen for their distinctive characters in their legal and regulatory frameworks. The corporate and securities laws in China reflect a mixture of its civil law tradition, British law influence through Hong Kong, and American law impact as a result of the bulk of Chinese scholars and regulators studying in the U.S..  On the other hand, despite its common law heritage, the U.S. corporate and securities laws have developed along a unique track due to competition among states and unparalleled depth of its capital market. The topics to be discussed are chosen mainly from the Chinese perspective, with their functional equivalents in the U.S. law are compared. The purpose of the course is threefold.  First, we will learn the basic rules of corporate and securities laws in China and the U.S.. Second, we will understand the social and economic rationales underlying the different rules and practices in these two jurisdictions. Finally, using law as a gateway, we will explore some important business and financial activities in the world’s two largest economies."

Without law, said Thomas Hobbes, life would be nasty, brutish, and short. The Hobbesian reference to automata has also been identified as one of earliest conceptions of artificial intelligence. Thus began a long entanglement between law and computing technologies. The first people to “Code” were lawyers, not programmers. Leibniz, famous for inventing calculus, held a doctorate in law. So too did Schumpeter, the ‘father’ of innovation theory.\n\nBut lawyers today are not known for technological competence. Google “why are lawyers bad at” and autocomplete suggests “math”.  US lawmakers hauled Facebook before them only to explain how the internet works.  And the US Supreme Court, suggests Nate Silver, is “allergic” to statistics.  These are the people responsible for writing, interpreting, and in some sense enforcing the laws that govern technology.\n\nThis course aim to plug the puzzling chasm between lawyers and technologists by introducing tomorrow’s lawyers to what technology is and how it is regulated by, and itself regulates, law. We will cover four key themes in particular:\n\n1. The History of Law and Technology\n2. Regulating The New Web\n3. Artificial Intelligence and Law\n4. Legal Technology\n\nIndividual readings will be assigned each week.  The overarching goal is to initiate students to the growing world of law and technology and equip them with the basic skills and vocabulary for more focused electives and self-study."

We will not only analyze different ways how governments are accountable to their citizens, but also look at empirical evidence on the economic effects of governance design choices. The fifth part deals with fundamental rights and addresses in particular the structure of the fundamental rights analyses. In many jurisdictions, the proportionality test is at the heart of the fundamental rights analysis. We will look at how proportionality varies according to different constitutional contexts and also look at functional equivalents in jurisdictions that have not adopted the proportionality test.

As well as enhancing their legal knowledge, students will hone their writing and editing skills, and learn to communicate their analysis in a manner which is helpful to both lawyers and non-lawyers. This will also help students develop their body of work as they move from school into practice.\n\nStudents should propose their own ideas (ideally involving issues of practical significance, analysis of which would be helpful to practitioners and/or the general public), so that they can be matched with a mentor with the appropriate expertise.\n\nStudents will work closely together with their graduate mentor on their commentaries or articles, crafting their work and receiving feedback and comments on a pre-agreed schedule. Students can also build up their networking skills through these mentorships.\n\nAt the end of the course, students will have produced one case commentary or article of around 6,000 words. The students can submit their papers to SMU Lexicon or other forums. (Publication is not a requirement for the course grade, but the course will help you towards that goal.)"

ICT is changing the socio-economic environment and the way we behave and transact on a global scale. Terms such as “the gig economy”, “disruptive innovations”, “big data”, “social media” and “the Internet of Things” describe some of these changes.\n\nIn relation to the law in this area, Asia has only more recently begun to catch up on the laws to deal with these issues. For example, Singapore has released many new and amended laws within the last decade alone that relate to infocomm developments. More recent amendments include changes to the Electronic Transactions Act of 2010 relating to e-contracts, e-signature and intermediary liability; the enactment of the Personal Data Protection Act in 2012 relating to data protection, the do-not-call registry and the Spam Control Act; changes to content regulations, specifically the class licensing regulations in 2013; the Protection from Harassment Act of 2014 and amendments to the Copyright Act in 2014 and 2016. In 2018, the Singapore legislature is expected to produce more new laws to deal with the fake news phenomenon and electric payment systems as well as in the areas of cybersecurity, electronic transactions and data protection.\n\nOther than the legal changes in Singapore, the latest trends and developments in other jurisdictions, with a focus on the Asian region, will be considered where relevant."

We will explore the role of law in Singapore in the management of both public power and the sphere of private dealings between persons. This will be done through a study of the various sources of law and their nature; the legal institutions and the relations between them; and foundational principles and values.\n\nWe will begin by exploring the concept of law and the ideals of constitutionalism, democracy, the rule of law, and the separation of powers – all of which pertain to the ways in which power is defined and limited by law. Besides studying what law is, we will study tools and concepts which have some degree of formality but are not law, such as policies and decisions by those who hold discretionary powers.\n\nHaving inquired into these ideas, we will go on to explore the various institutions of the state and their roles, as well as the values that animate them. This is important because law does not put itself into action; legal institutions breathe life into laws by interpreting them, executing them, and serving as sites of contestation as to how they are to be interpreted and executed. We will discuss matters such as different modes of lawmaking and their relative advantages and disadvantages; the role of the state in controlling its own power; and the limits to law as a means of governing society. Finally, we will apply all this knowledge by focusing our attention on a few discrete areas of law as case studies.\n\nWhile this course will focus on Singapore, comparisons will be drawn with other legal systems, particularly the UK’s, when appropriate."

The course will entail not only classroom teaching and learning, but will also include invaluable sharing sessions guest speakers from various relevant fields, as well as field trips to legal institutions and/or offices in Singapore.\n\nA substantial part of the course will be dedicated to exploring, at a general level, various aspects of laws pertaining to doing business, with an especial focus on business organisations and commercial transactions.\n\nWith cross-border business dealings being the norm instead of the exception, an understanding of the implications of contractual clauses in international contracts, and of the avenues for the resolution of international disputes, also become essential.\n\nBecause business relationships with commercial parties are primarily governed by contract, an understanding of how contracts work is important. Basic principles of contract law (e.g. the making and performance of contracts), as well as laws applying to specific situations (e.g. the sale of goods and services), will be taught in brief. Students will also be introduced to the law of torts and will, in particular, learn the essentials of the very pervasive tort of negligence, and the often-misunderstood tort of defamation."

As environmental and social problems mount around the world, firms have become more attuned to the need to devise new products, services and strategies, and to communicate these to a variety of stakeholders, even as they cooperate with them.\n\nEnvironmental sustainability, and more generally, sustainability, has become increasingly important to developed and developing nations alike. Typical issues include resource scarcity and polluted environments, but more recently, global climate change has become the primary issue for many. In general, sustainability issues often consist of complex interactions between human activity and the environment. The course will apply several academic perspectives to characterizing these problems and their possible solutions.\n\nThe course will focus in particular on businesses’ role in causing and addressing sustainability problems and on how they moderate their impacts. An important part of addressing the sustainability of firms is the employment of various concepts and frameworks that help incorporate the sustainability perspective into firms’ strategies and operations. To help characterize firms’ sustainability and determine appropriate courses of action, the course will cover specific managerial tools and frameworks. The primary focus will be on strategy and business models that support change and its operationalization, but the course will also illustrate the role that “greening” other business functions play in the sustainability of the firm, including those of marketing, supply chains, and financing. The course will review core management frameworks to help non-business major students become familiar with more sustainability-specific frameworks, practices and concepts to be covered. These tools are not only means for improving a firm’s sustainability performance, but also support its transparent and effective reporting. Representative examples of sustainability measurement standards will be introduced and their potential impacts in advancing corporate sustainability will be discussed. The course will also reflect on the general role of innovation in all of this. Technology issues covered include the role of information technology in addressing poverty, and solutions that reorganize the industrial system (e.g. renewable energy policies, and industrial ecosystems or industrial symbiosis, i.e., industries that incorporate recycling loops at regional levels)."

However, companies that are able to strategically change their entrenched ways of doing things and then reclaim leading positions are the exception rather than the rule. With the industry 4.0 upon us and fast advancement in digital technologies, firms in many industries would find it even more pressing but challenging to build the managerial capabilities to cope with the digital transformation that will reshape the business landscape tremendously for the future. Against this backdrop, this course discusses how companies can effectively manage the strategic change and digital transformation that will significantly impact the way the business is configured for competitive advantage. Besides the internal managerial challenge, the course also emphasizes that companies must cope with strategic interactions with different industry players to create value collectively and continuously. With respect to digital transformation, the course discusses digital concepts and technologies such as omni-channel, platforms, eco-systems, blockchain, IOT, AI, and cloud computing etc. that impose both challenges and opportunities for strategic change management in the increasingly technology-based, internet-based, and data-based business contexts."

        "institution": "SMU",
        "description": "This course will explore how ‘play’ can enhance creative design processes to promote innovation and invention. Play was borne out of not only human desires for leisure and frivolity, but cultural and biological needs such as learning and community bonding. Recently, it has been observed that inventors in history have conceived of new ideas and products, even technological inventions, in a playful manner (Johnson, 2016). Playful invention processes could be serious experimental (and risky) efforts, or playfully frivolous ones. The course will analyze and apply creative and inventive processes, with the focus on how the mind can explore more widely and inventively by becoming less self-conscious and critical through play.\n\nPlayful invention facilitates creativity by blending ideas together from different domains, causing ‘forms’ to transcend boundaries, and ultimately, to reshape not only leisure, but other domains and culture itself. This creative blending helps cross-fertilize domains with new ideas. We will examine how inventors ‘playfully created’ in different domains such as narrative, visual arts, space (including architectural space), and games. While most of the cultural domains covered relate to historical and current popular culture, we also pay attention to specific local and ‘globalized national’ cultures.\n\nAt least half of the course focuses on the actual practice of techniques that are related to the conceptual study of domains and thinking processes. We will adapt the design thinking process to incorporate additional brainstorming techniques (including domain-specific ideation techniques) and user-centered prototyping while removing the ‘project client’ typically seen in design thinking projects. In addition, we will illustrate and practice how to design using domains as lenses into the design of forms related to those domains.\n\nA significant part of the course will involve a project to design an innovative experience or other ‘form’ using these creativity and design techniques. In-class (or online) group exercises and projects will be used to demonstrate and practice these techniques, and full class attendance is expected in order to participate in these group exercises and group work."

Please note that the course has a heavy theoretical basis. This involves building a deeper understanding of how digital media products like games come about and work. We do this by understanding how creativity, culture, technology, and processes (e.g. product development and organizational) are integrated into these media. This will help to appreciate industry and business issues. In particular, the course discusses the central role of creativity in these selected industries, as well as the factors that influence or constrain this creativity. We draw most of our examples from the video game industry, and to some extent, “digital” media such as social media, but we will also make comparisons with other industries such as IT, design, film, and animation. The course is interdisciplinary, and readings and theories will be drawn from the business, social science, and media studies traditions."

The course will scrutinize their role as well as some of the (culturally biased) misperceptions about their business conduct. The degree, to which their extensive business networks succeed because of ethnic characteristics, or simply because of the sound application of good business practice, is a key issue that will be discussed throughout the course.

The 21 economies of the largest trans-Pacific grouping, Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC), account for nearly half of global trade. The region comprises not only the world’s ‘factory floor’ but also its most important sources of services, technology and investments, and final goods markets,” writes Peter Petri, an international trade economist.   Yet despite the much celebrated economic progress of the region and the potential to be reaped from it, there are clear strains and risks resulting from geopolitical and economic trends which impact businesses that operate here.\n\nThis course consists of a set of core lectures which will introduce students to: (a) economic, political and socio-cultural theories and frameworks for understanding the context of business in the Asia Pacific region; and (b) the application of international business theories and frameworks to understand the decision-making processes of companies investing in the region. Course participants are expected to apply theories and frameworks to assess business environments of specific Asian economies.  Participants are expected to analyse and make presentations about issues and challenges that are relevant to companies operating in large emerging economies such as China, India, Taiwan, and South Korea but also other economies such as Myanmar, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam."

Different countries have different systems of capitalism and deal with this relationship in very different ways.  Because of these differences, specific systems and practices of corporate governance differ greatly around the world and in Asia. These differences, however, have been under pressure, as capital, management, and business practices become more global. Indeed, many Asian countries have revised their corporate governance system that is more consistent with global rules and expectations of investors who invest globally.  \n\nThis course aims to make participants aware of the key issues that are related to corporate governance in especially the Asian context by examining corporate governance practices in various Asian countries and comparing them with non-Asian models, specifically the US and Germany.  Participants will be equipped with the conceptual frameworks and tools to understand and analyze the issues that are pertinent to corporate governance practices as well as their impacts on other issues such as firm performance, business ethics, and firm strategy."

Also, mentors will give the team feedback on their market testing process.\n\nStudent teams (3 tor 5 students per team) can be preformed before the course or can be formed in the first three weeks of the course. If you have an idea but lack team members, or you lack an idea but would like to join a team visit this web page https://smu.sg/1lq to post your ideas and seek team members or views ideas and to join originators of ideas as team members. If you are interested in the course and want to find team members please send an email to adamequek@smu.edu.sg with the header ‘Entrepreneurship Practicum”.\n\nThe student team business idea should be scalable, i.e., the aspiration of the student team should be to have at least 10 employees or $1 million in revenue within five years. If the business is a social entrepreneurship, a similar metric for social impact as appropriate will be encouraged.  Student teams, as pre-formed, will remain the same for the duration of the course. Any disagreements within a team will have to be resolved by the team members themselves.\n\nThis course is not for students with more mature businesses; students who already have a business with finished products and/or services and with customers are encouraged to approach SMU-IIE for entry into the incubation program."

For those graduates who choose a start-up or SME, there is also a government initiative to encourage more Singaporean firms to establish operations overseas so it is important to understand the challenges and process of doing so. Accordingly, this Capstone course integrates content drawn from practice and research on establishing a business overseas and managing a multinational, as well as, an X-Culture SMU-X experiential exercise with a real company so the student:\n\n1. Understands the topology of differences (cognitive, cultural, nation state, institutional, business systems, market economies, economic maturity, and geographic) that exists, particularly, among countries in Asia, and must be accommodated within an internationalised business model as SMEs/MNCs establish operations outside their home country.\n\n2. Builds upon their prior courses, particularly business strategy, to understand the process of formulating and operationalising a strategy to internationalise towards foreign markets, as well as, the considerations and trade-offs when executing those steps. This will include an understanding of the roles and management interactions of locals versus expatriates, as well as, among host country subsidiaries, regional offices, and corporate headquarters. Emphasis is applied to understanding the strategic advantages possessed by a multinational; their ability to transfer such advantages from its home to host markets; as well as, the capacity of corporate headquarters to absorb new knowledge from its foreign operations in order to sustain and enhance its engagement within Asia.\n\n3. Experiences what it is like to work in a MNC by applying a cross-disciplinary approach as a member of a global cross-cultural team. After all, reading a textbook does not allow a true appreciation of the reality of international cross-cultural business collaboration – one must experience it! You will apply both the course content and your accumulated academic knowledge at SMU in providing recommendations to a real-life SME as to a new market entry strategy (or similar assignment) encompassing market selection, entry method, marketing and operational considerations. As a participant in this global X-Culture initiative the SMU student will work in teams drawn among 5,000 students from 150 participating universities within 40 countries around the globe. After the successful completion of the exercise, in addition to the normal SMU grade, students will receive a X-Culture certificate, a performance report, and a recommendation letter reflecting your performance. The best teams will also be invited to the X-Culture Global Symposium held in July each year.\n\nConsistent with SMU’s experiential and formative teaching pedagogy, there will be three short quizzes throughout the term to promote greater knowledge retention (there is no final exam). In addition, you will choose your own local SMU teams to participate in the ‘Great SMU Debate’ and a case study prior to embarking on the X-Culture experiential exercise with your global teams during the second part of the course."

Problems juggling multiple roles (often termed work-nonwork/ family conflict) result in negative outcomes for individuals (e.g., poor health) and organizations (e.g., turnover of star employees). However, engaging in multiple roles also has benefits for individuals and organizations. Drawing especially on current academic research and global organizational practices, students are provided with a broad overview of related topics by exposing them to a variety of theories, concepts, findings, and unresolved issues within this area. Multiple activities will help students identify individual preferences for roles, gain skills to better balance of roles, and create a modifiable, goal-directed framework related to their current and future selves."

It is designed to allow students to translate classroom knowledge into professional experience. It is a unique oppor-tunity to learn more about consulting services and apply theoretical knowledge to a real business project. The core focus of this class rests on a group work built around a real world business project offered by one of our corpo-rarte partners. For each session (G1 and G2), we are collaborating with more than twelve different corporate partners with each student group benefitting from an exclusive relationship to their own corporate partner. The corporate projects cover different industries and different topics. Students are invited to share their preferences with which corporate partner (and thereby in which industry or on what topic focus) they wish to work and gain experience.\n\nThis SMU-X course is a combination of advanced in-class learning and practical interaction with the business world via project work and guest lecturers who work/have worked with major consultancy companies such as McKinsey, BCG, or Bain. The lectures introduce the world of consulting by teaching the basic steps and tools used during the consulting process. You will learn how consultants frame, analyse and solve problems and how they present their solutions to their clients. You will obtain tools and frameworks to reduce complexity and structure a project. Sev-eral mini cases and lived situations with your corporate partner will help you to develop an understanding of how to approach a business project and manage the relationship with your corporate partner as a client. Guest lectures will provide you with industry insights and hands-on experiences about the day-to-day business of a consultant.\n\nThe unique opportunity to explore, learn, and directly apply competencies in a real life, multidisciplinary, team-based consulting experience with a company/organization is the distinguishing feature of this course. You will be working in teams for (large) corporations or smaller startups, acting as student consultants working on real challenges the organizations presently face. The solutions you develop will be presented to the senior management of the compa-nies. In previous semesters, our corporate partners included DBS (banking), Adidas (sports apparel), WWF (nature conservancy), Nestlé (nutrition), SingPost (logistics), Lufthansa (airline), CapitaLand (real estate), Sygnum (fintech), Lazada (E-commerce) and many more."

We will examine individual leaders (What can we learn in contrasting the leadership of Apple vs. Samsung?), leadership teams (What composition of a top management team works best when comparing companies such as Petronas and BP?), and board composition (What can we learn from the governance structures of Yahoo! and Google?). Whether it is a Fortune 100 company or a small start-up, the individual executives, top management teams, and the governing bodies (board of directors) make an impact on the outcomes of the firm.

Sustainability practitioners must not only help develop (i.e., design) and sell a sustainable product or service, but an entire mind-set, and where necessary, to devise changes in business models and operations. The course will guide students, working in teams, through a development process involving market and strategic assessment, positioning of the product (including its sustainability attributes), customer-centric design, and business model innovation. This will in turn lead students to develop value propositions and marketing, which will be presented in a final pitch session to the client’s representatives. The primary methodology will consist of design thinking techniques, which will be broadly used and adapted to the sustainability context. Phases of design include the understanding of candidate consumers’ (users’) needs by qualitative means, creation of basic product concepts and prototypes, and the testing and validation of prototypes with users. Implications will also be drawn for the client’s business model. Note that the course may be more time-intensive than a content-based or normal SMU-X course, as it centers on a project with a methodology (design thinking), but also involves content on sustainability and business, and involves some use of analytical techniques such as secondary market research (e.g. assembling of data on consumer segment numbers). Note that the data and analysis may change depending on the client involved. As an example, a past class client was a multinational nutritional supplements company interested in servicing Asian markets with a sustainability value proposition. Future clients will be different firms."

Their implications will be discussed in an Asian context. We will contrast findings, practices and lessons learnt for future Managers operating in Asia when analyzing the effects of e.g. resource scarcity, societal stress, demographic change, migration, globalization as well as the economic system. A particular focus will be assigned to the rise of China and its geo-political implications on its Asian neighbours. Further, we will explore developments in key technology areas (e.g. artificial intelligence, biotech, nanotech, cyber security and space exploration).\nIn particular, we will debate implications on Singapore’s transition into a knowledge-, innovation- and service based economy as an example to contrast initiatives in other Asian Megacities, such as Shanghai, Jakarta or Mumbai. Special topics on “Asian Cultures“, “Finite System Thinking”, “Non-linear Behaviour”, “Risk Mitigation” and “Venture Capital in Asia” complement the course.

        "description": "At the end of 1945, the areas bordering the Straits of Malacca were facing recovery from wartime destruction and the sharp decline of colonial rule.  Indonesia, the largest and most geographically widespread, in 1945 was the first to become independent.  Formed in 1948, the Federation of Malaya became independent in 1957.  The city state of Singapore broke off from Malaya and became independent in 1965.  At this point, these three post-colonial countries were at somewhat similar levels of development (although the British had treated Singapore as an urban center and a major port -- not an agricultural resource).  All three were low income countries with per capita GDP ranging from $56 in Indonesia, $333 in Malaysia to $516 in Singapore.  Indonesia and Malaysia possessed significant natural resources, whereas Singapore (now cut off from Malaysia) was bereft even of water.  Over the past fifty years, the political and economic choices made in the three countries have varied, and their growth trajectories diverged.  Today, per capita GDP varies greatly:  Indonesia, $3,491; Malaysia, $11,307; and Singapore, $56,284 (World Bank data).\n\nThese three countries have pursued different pathways which to some extent can be explained by economic drivers, but also by government policy choices with regard to inclusive growth.  The course will consider this in the context of business in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, and will study it from multiple perspectives:  government, corporate/family business, and social impact. To examine this in a one-week timeframe, we will focus on the development of infrastructure, real estate (housing), education and health care.\n \nResource-rich environments attract investors, but managing today in countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia where governments are sensitive to issues of competitive and strategic sustainability, raises challenges.  Having moved from low income status to low middle-middle income status, Indonesia and Malaysia face the challenge of avoiding the “middle-income trap,” the situation where developing economies’ convergence to the development frontier comes to a halt once their income per capita reaches a middle-income level.  In contrast, Singapore surmounted that challenged, but now as an advanced market economy, it faces the challenge of a small, high wage country (5.5 million): the need to innovate to remain competitive at this level."

        "description": "The SIE6011A-MGMT340 Understanding Chinese Culture and Business Environment program comprises some of the most economically significant Chinese cities located in the southern parts of China. This program is designed to develop students’ appreciation of the nuances of China’s business practices in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) and the Shantou Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in South China. It explores the various unique aspects of China’s history, culture, society, value system, business practices, and its implication to doing business in this tectonic economy.\n\nThe course seeks to understand the knowledge and behaviours necessary to successfully meander through China’s business environment, encouraging the student to take a truly local perspective in dealing with dynamic management issues in this diverse eco-system. It emphasizes how the variables of politico-socio-cultural practices interact with other national and international factors to affect managerial processes and behaviours, and illustrates current developments and trends. In addition, the growing competitive influence of e-commerce will also be considered. The highlight of the course is its emphasis on experiential education – interaction with government representatives and senior business practitioners.\n\nThe scope of the coursework includes assessing China’s unique business eco-system (political, economic, legal), appreciating China’s leadership, understanding various aspects of doing business in China, learning Chinese etiquette, fostering successful relationships (the importance and the art of relationships), and getting a glimpse of China’s economic future development.\n\nThroughout the course, the students are expected to apply what they have learned in the course and assess the relevance of these factors in doing business in China."

        "description": "This course initiative rests on the assumption that there is a powerful synergy between ‘sustainability’ and ‘innovation’ in business and society. The term ‘sustainable innovation’ refers to the creation of new market space, products and services or processes driven by social, environmental or sustainability concerns. Just like general innovation, sustainable innovation goes way beyond incremental improvements of products, services or processes. The challenge is to proactively embrace risk management and sustainability considerations (environmental, social, financial) aimed at aligning (novel) business strategies with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to create and capture new value. If managed well by results-oriented, socially aware sustainability leaders, sustainable innovation results not only in greater effectiveness at (intra)organisational levels but also helps to create a cleaner, healthier, fairer (and hopefully more stable) world as envisaged by the circular economy. The urgent need for sustainability has never been greater as evidenced by rapid population growth, pollution, (toxic) waste, plastic accumulating in our oceans, limited natural resources, climate change etc. This course will introduce students to the managerial discipline of innovation management with particular reference to examples of ‘good’ / ‘best’ sustainable innovation practices adopted by both local and international organisations such as City Development Limited (CDL), Banyan Tree, Sustainability Center Freiburg (launched in 2015 by the University of Freiburg in cooperation with five Fraunhofer research institutes), Henkel BeautyCare (whose Social Plastic Ecosystem in partnership with the Plastic Bank social enterprise is aimed at stopping ocean plastic and simultaneously providing opportunities for people in poverty), Procter & Gamble’s Tide Eco-Box (which contains less packaging, 60% less plastic and 30% less water than the current Tide press-tap) and many more."

Many are setting up family offices to facilitate this succession planning and wealth transfer.\n\nFamily offices are privately owned entities that manage the private wealth and other affairs of the family including philanthropy, education, and estate planning. In Singapore, family offices are required to have at least $10 million of assets under management (AUM), with many more than $100 million in AUM. Beyond managing the family wealth, the family office also supports the family’s vision and legacy, and helps to support important transitions in ownership, leadership, and wealth.\n\nSingapore has gained prominence as the preferred base for family offices, with their numbers doubling to 400 in 2020 as compared to the year before. This trend is expected to continue. Family offices by nature are private, closely held entities. However, with the phenomenal increase in the number of family offices, there is a corresponding spike in demand for professionals familiar with managing the family office.\n\nThe BFI Family Office Management Work-Study Elective is a collaboration with family offices and their advisors that will provide students with the opportunity to undergo a 5-month extended internship programme in a partner company. Most family offices are led by family principals and staffed by small teams of senior professionals with decades of experience.\n\nHence, the work-study elective presents valuable opportunities for students to take on a broader range of responsibilities and to learn directly from senior management, compared to junior internships at a larger corporate organization.\n\nThe BFI Family Office Management Work-Study Elective involves an internship locally, where students enrolled will work for at least four days each week at the host company and take courses on campus for up to one day each week for up to five months.\n\nWhile undertaking this elective, students may enroll in up to 2 course units (CU) of courses, as long as there is no timetable clash with the internship requirements.\n\nThis Work-Study Elective is open to all SMU students who meet the pre-requisites."

A quick search across the internet shows that the benefits of entrepreneurship include but are not limited to the following: accelerating economic growth, promoting innovation, promoting social changes, promoting research and industrial development, and developing and improving existing enterprises. Start-ups and small businesses also have a disproportionate impact on job creation, accounting for 64% of new jobs and contributing to 20 percent of gross job creation. , , , ,\n\nIn Singapore, a survey in 2012 as part of a Global Entrepreneurship Monitoring study indicates that 21.4% of people in Singapore intend to start a company in the next three years, ranked second among OECD countries.  This indicates the great interest for entrepreneurship in Singapore alone. Beyond this, the trend for entrepreneurship investment in China, India, and Southeast Asia is also encouraging. Both from the input (number of graduates and family business) as well as from the demand (number of deals and capital invested by angel investors and Venture Capitalists along with the amount that governments invested as limited partners). \n\nThe importance of entrepreneurship, however, goes beyond job creation. It provides an ideal setting to train and equip individuals with skills they need for the future. While the future always seems uncertain, McKinsey, one of the leading management consultant firms in the world, has suggested that cognitive capability, interpersonal skills, and self-leadership are critical part of it. These are all skills that entrepreneurship is rather uniquely positioned to train."

        "description": "Necessity is the mother of invention. One reason for firms to innovate is the necessity to re-invent themselves and get out of stagnation: the industry has either gotten obsolete, or competitors have adopted newer and more efficient business models, and products or services based on more advanced technologies. Innovation is then a necessity as the firm has to innovate or perish, one only has to look at what happened to Blockbuster and Kodak. Blockbuster at one point of time was the leading media rental firm in the world, but they chose to ignore innovation in the way they were delivering their media content to customers. As Netflix gained scale, Blockbuster’s inability to innovate meant that their business model was obsolete, and they had no choice but to file for bankruptcy. Kodak is another famous example: Steven Sasson at Kodak invented the digital camera way back in the 1970s, but rather than developing and commercializing the innovation, Kodak chose to put the new technology on the backburner, as its commercialization would have meant that their existing business model that relied on chemical printing of photographs would have to be cannibalized. However, other competitors jumped on the bandwagon for competitive advantage: hence, if you do not pursue innovation, your competitors will make you obsolete someday, no product or business model has an eternal shelf life. Innovation has many dimensions: it creates value for existing customers, thereby letting you keep your current market share; it creates value for new customers, enabling you to get growth; it enables you to work with new processes to access a lower cost base; supplier innovation enables you to leverage partners’ innovation capabilities to offer value to customers, and capture value for yourself. So the notion of continuous improvement is indeed extendable to continuous innovation, the business world in all sectors moves on a treadmill; the pace of the treadmill is faster in some industries like technology and fashion, and slower in some other industries. Innovation is the lever that enables you to keep pace on the treadmill if you are at the industry average; and enables you to set the pace if you innovate at a faster rate than the industry average. If you stand still on the treadmill or run at a slower pace than the treadmill in a competitive environment, at some stage, you will be thrown off the treadmill.\n\nThis course should be of particular interest to people aspiring for a career in designing and managing for innovation, either directly (e.g., V.P. of R&D, R&D Manager) or indirectly (e.g., management consulting). The course will also be useful to SME proprietors and entrepreneurs who intend to serve new markets, or use new technologies, or participants who wish to strategically reposition their offerings in an existing market. The course should also be of interest to people who manage interfaces between innovation and business functions such as finance, marketing, managerial accounting and human resources."

        "description": "In this course of strategic management, the students will be exposed to the analysis of complex competitive situations that require a multidisciplinary approach from the perspective of top management.\n\nThrough the discussion of cases and related readings, the course focuses on strategic analysis and how to build competitive advantage at the business and corporate levels in our global economy. The main theories, models and tools within the field of strategy will be covered with a strong emphasis in its application to real settings. We will use the tools that help top management analyze the business environment, formulate strategies and make decisions in competitive situations.\n\nThe course is divided in three parts.\n\nThe first part introduces tools to understand the industry structure and economics that determinate industry-wide profitability and are the base of every individual firm’s business strategy and resulting profitability, focusing on both resource/organizational and positional aspects.\nThe second part studies firm and industry dynamics, focusing on the changes in competition and the reaction of individual firms to the changes in their environment. We will use basic game theory as a tool to analyze competitive interactions when the number of players is small and the industry is being shaped by the interactions between those players. We will look at issues such as bargaining power, price competition, entry and exit decisions, standard setting and platform and technology based competition.\n\nIn the third part of the course we will work at the corporate and international strategy level and we will take a close look at the most fundamental issue in management. Why does one business meet its objectives, while another firm, apparently equally strong, fail? The goal of any firm is to develop a winning strategy and to build a successful organization. This is a tough job. So let us begin with the most obvious of facts: every organization is different. From this simple fact we can derive something quite useful for us as strategists: different firms in the same sector will have different strategies. A key reason is that the management teams evaluate differently the competitive environment and hence decide on different strategies but success does not depend solely on selecting a winning strategy: the achievement of results depends as well on the effectiveness of management. We must ask ourselves why one firm builds a strong, adaptive organization capable of creating and responding to competitive strategy, while a second firm patches together an organization that stumbles from initiative to initiative?"

While the most visible outcome of this course is a written opportunity report, we will also examine entrepreneurship from a managerial perspective, covering a wide area of issues that emerge with starting and growing new ventures\n– be they independent or corporate projects.\n\nThe 8 sessions that compose this course aim to give you a well-rounded learning experience, which will enable you to develop skills and apply tools vital in today’s business world, whether you explore it as an entrepreneur or a corporate manager. The theory you will receive from lectures and class readings will serve as a backbone to a range of hands-on experiences through case discussions, coaching sessions, teamwork, and so forth. By keeping the class experience on the interface between theory and practice, the course structure will lead you through the entrepreneurial process.\n\nThe cases, exercises, and projects will expose you to viewpoints on both sides of the table – that of the entrepreneur and that of the investor. Moreover, the settings in our case studies cover a range of industries and markets, from ventures backed by sophisticated investors to those funded by friends. By exposing you to a broad range of settings in which entrepreneurs  operate, the intent is to break the myth that entrepreneurship is limited to a few heroic figures covered in popular press, but if we so desire, accessible to all of us.\n\nThis entrepreneurship course is envisioned as a highly interactive class, where students learn from each other’s experiences through class discussion. In that sense, while I will do my best to provide you with interesting materials and facilitate discussion to highlight learning points, much of your learning depends on your preparation, participation, and contribution.\n\nUpon the completion of this course, participants should:\n\n- Know how to recognize and evaluate venture opportunities, understanding both the entrepreneur’s and the investor’s perspective;\n\n- Understand the issues faced by entrepreneurs when starting a venture, as well as acquire some of the fundamental skills and tools required for embarking on a new project in an independent and in a corporate context;\n\n- Understand the nature of opportunities in the context of new and/or growing ventures and be able to write a good opportunity report."

However, there are some common underlying themes of research methods across areas, that can be ported across different streams of literature to enable researchers to learn from diverse streams of research. In this course, we will take a deep dive into the research methods used in areas as diverse as Operations Management, Strategy, Economics, OBHR, Accounting and Finance.\n\nResearch methods usually vary by the richness of the literature in the desired field of study, Exploratory research is typically conducted at the beginning of the evolution of a field, when the questions associated with a topic are not well understood, studies in this phase are largely driven by observations in the industry, and an understanding of common practices, coupled with theoretical arguments of what constitutes good practice. Gradually, an established theory evolves that becomes the dominant theory to explain the topic, after that, the research on the topic moves to the descriptive phase, in which the research methods used are more detailed, causal effects can be established, and the data gathering and analysis processes are based more on involved econometric analyses. In this course, we will look largely at exploratory research methods used in the areas of as Operations Management, Strategy, Economics, OBHR, Accounting and Finance, as exploratory early stage research typically leads to a higher impact."

We will cover principles of experimentation at the technical and strategic levels for business practice, including key considerations in designing an experiment. We will focus on types of experiments that are most frequently used by empirical researchers who apply this scientific technique (1) to address managerial decision problems in areas such as marketing, organizational behavior, and behavioral economics, and more generally (2) to collect data for causal inference.\n\nSpecifically, we will examine experimental methods from the perspective of an applied empirical researcher interested in studying the behavior of individuals, crowds and organisations. We will not be discussing experimental methods through the lens of a statistician, whose focus would be on the statistical theory of novel experimental design and the derivation of its mathematical foundations. This course is aimed at doctoral-level students who intend to conduct experimental and quasi-experimental research in business contexts. To facilitate our discussion, we will use marketing as an illustrative context—we will present examples of experimental design and technique and discuss how experimentation is applied to improve strategic marketing decisions."

This course is divided into two sections that cover (1) research methods used to generate rigorous evidence and (2) analytical methods used to generate insights for HC decisions. \n\nResearch methods represent the “how” of the scientific study of theoretical and applied questions. Appropriate research methods allow us to rigorously investigate and develop evidence to address important problems. This section of the course is an introductory master-level seminar on empirical research methods in the context of business research. It will focus on different types of research designs and methods, such as lab experiments, field experiments, and survey research. It is meant to help students make informed choices about designing and conducting their own research studies effectively and ethically.\n\nHC analytics focuses on the use of people data for HC decisions and it involves mapping HC initiatives to business outcomes.  The key benefits of employing HC analytics include quantifying returns on HC investments and optimizing employee investments to achieve tangible business outcomes. However, the challenge faced by HC practitioners lies in knowing what to analyze and how to analyze.  Reports have revealed that only a small percentage of HC practitioners are proficient in undertaking advanced univariate analyses and that an even fewer number can perform advanced multivariate analyses.  This proficiency gap suggests a need for HC practitioners to be more competent in this field. The focus of this section of the course is to narrow this gap, allowing HC professionals to play a more strategic role within their organizations through equipping them with the ability to undertake some useful HC analytics on available organizational employee data. The course will use the SPSS software package, chosen for its ease of use and commercial accessibility."

Applications of design thinking to product and service innovation will be discussed, along with varying of the design contexts, including the private sector, government and social sectors. Participants learn to think like innovators, from the initial idea to managing resources, building partnerships with committed stakeholders and dealing with contingencies. In parallel, participants are encouraged to consider their individual accomplishments and how these might support new venture creation.

We examine how companies have embarked on their growth stories and the routes they have chosen. Next, we take a deep dive into business models. What are business models and what makes for a good one? Specifically, we consider what makes a business model scalable by adopting the RTVN (Resources, Transactions, Values, and Narratives) framework. In the second half of the course, we integrate diverse disciplines, considering the roles of human and social capital, governance and operations management and internationalisation in business growth. We conclude with a discussion on sustainability and the new technologies that are driving business innovation."

        "description": "Necessity is the mother of invention. One reason for firms to innovate is the necessity to re-invent themselves and get out of stagnation: the industry has either gotten obsolete, or competitors have adopted newer and more efficient business models, and products or services based on more advanced technologies. Innovation is then a necessity as the firm has to innovate or perish, one only has to look at what happened to Blockbuster and Kodak. Blockbuster at one point of time was the leading media rental firm in the world, but they chose to ignore innovation in the way they were delivering their media content to customers. As Netflix gained scale, Blockbuster’s inability to innovate meant that their business model was obsolete, and they had no choice but to file for bankruptcy. Kodak is another famous example: Steven Sasson at Kodak invented the digital camera way back in the 1970s, but rather than developing and commercializing the innovation, Kodak chose to put the new technology on the backburner, as its commercialization would have meant that their existing business model that relied on chemical printing of photographs would have to be cannibalized. However, other competitors jumped on the bandwagon for competitive advantage: hence, if you do not pursue innovation, your competitors will make you obsolete someday, no product or business model has an eternal shelf life. Innovation has many dimensions: it creates value for existing customers, thereby letting you keep your current market share; it creates value for new customers, enabling you to get growth; it enables you to work with new processes to access a lower cost base; supplier innovation enables you to leverage partners’ innovation capabilities to offer value to customers, and capture value for yourself. So the notion of continuous improvement is indeed extendable to continuous innovation, the business world in all sectors moves on a treadmill; the pace of the treadmill is faster in some industries like technology and fashion, and slower in some other industries. Innovation is the lever that enables you to keep pace on the treadmill if you are at the industry average; and enables you to set the pace if you innovate at a faster rate than the industry average. If you stand still on the treadmill or run at a slower pace than the treadmill in a competitive environment, at some stage, you will be thrown off the treadmill.\nThis course should be of particular interest to people aspiring for a career in designing and managing for innovation, either directly (e.g., V.P. of R&D, R&D Manager) or indirectly (e.g., management consulting). The course will also be useful to SME proprietors and entrepreneurs who intend to serve new markets, or use new technologies, or participants who wish to strategically reposition their offerings in an existing market. The course should also be of interest to people who manage interfaces between innovation and business functions such as finance, marketing, managerial accounting and human resources."

Although many businesses have benefited from the new technology, more of them are being threatened or have been displaced by it. From now, digital technology will only proliferate at an exponential rate and businesses who cannot harness such capabilities will experience an accelerated erosion of their competitive advantages in productivity, product and service offerings, staff quality, consumer loyalty, and many other areas. Despite the urgent need for digital transformation, many businesses have slid into what Gartner documented as the “Trough of Disillusionment”. Many explanatory factors were offered and most centred around the confusion of what digital transformation actually entails.\n\nWe define digital transformation as a movement centred around a digital-first thinking, as opposed to the misconceived technology-first or digital improvement approaches. A digital-first approach starts with a thorough understanding of the new paradigms of business strategy made possible by digital technologies, followed by a working understanding of the technologies involved, and most importantly, the organizational structure, teamwork, and culture that are necessary to support such endeavours. Digital transformation is not a patchwork of modular improvements designed for plug-and-play. It is a top-down, holistic, enlightened, determined, and dynamic (agile) movement aimed at persisting business performance.\n\nIn this course, students will be given the opportunity to master digital-first thinking via our three prong approach. We start with the inculcation of new digital drivers of disruptive businesses through frameworks, toolkits, and discussions. Following which, we introduce the essential building blocks of digital-first thinking to transform business value propositions, improve decision making, optimize organizational structures and processes, and create a new working culture that is needed for a digital-first organisation. In the third part, we will attempt to synergize what we have learned and collectively create strategies and roadmaps for existing and new industries of the future."

As such, we will use developments in statistical science to examine solutions to important issues faced in business analytics. There will be various cases and readings provided and used in the class to demonstrate the importance of data-driven decision making. Specifically, we will discuss regression, measuring online impact, machine learning techniques, conducting field experiments, and innovation in retail and digital analytics.

We will also do practical exercises in class involving “real” data. At the end of the course, you will be able to put these skills and tools to good use.\n\nThe course also includes a visit to a local company to review how they do HR Analytics, the HR Operations that supports it, and how the data is put to use to address business problems."

        "institution": "SMU",
        "description": "The purpose of this course is to help you better understand qualitative research methods so as to enable you to be a better researcher and reader of work that employs these types of methodologies. Given the breadth and variety of methods that fall under the rubric of “qualitative methods,” all classes will discuss general issues or skills that are applicable to several different methodological approaches.  You will notice that there is not a separate week on ethics.  Ethical treatment of those we study is crucial to all methodologies (quantitative and qualitative) – but ethical issues can be particularly acute in some forms of qualitative research.  As a result, we will integrate discussions of ethics throughout the course, and not relegate it to a weekly topic of discussion.\n\nQualitative methods courses in business schools are relatively rare. Ask most users of qualitative methods and they will talk about being trained using the apprenticeship model only. Taken together, this is both an exciting challenge and a daunting one – as there are few templates for such a course.  Consequently, your input will be essential in helping me refine and redesign the course as we go along. Thus, unlike other methods courses where you are “served” information, this course will be more like a “pot luck” with you bringing things to the class every week!\n\nThere will be many avenues for learning in this class: Each week we will read and discuss what academic scholars and researchers have written about a specific topic.  During the course, you will also do research on a specific methodology not covered in class. These will be the most “traditional” parts of class. Furthermore, in this course, I will give you a “hands on” experience and the opportunity to explore and experiment with some of the data collection and data analyses strategies.\n\nTo close, this course will be a lot of work -- but I also hope that it will also be enriching and fun!  By the time we are finished, you should have begun developing a unique skill set that should serve you well at work."

        "title": "Innovation Management",
        "institution": "SMU",
        "description": "Necessity is the mother of invention. One reason for firms to innovate is the necessity to re-invent themselves and get out of stagnation: the industry has either gotten obsolete, or competitors have adopted newer and more efficient business models, and products or services based on more advanced technologies. Innovation is then a necessity as the firm has to innovate or perish, one only has to look at what happened to Blockbuster and Kodak. Blockbuster at one point of time was the leading media rental firm in the world, but they chose to ignore innovation in the way they were delivering their media content to customers. As Netflix gained scale, Blockbuster’s inability to innovate meant that their business model was obsolete, and they had no choice but to file for bankruptcy. Kodak is another famous example: Steven Sasson at Kodak invented the digital camera way back in the 1970s, but rather than developing and commercializing the innovation, Kodak chose to put the new technology on the backburner, as its commercialization would have meant that their existing business model that relied on chemical printing of photographs would have to be cannibalized. However, other competitors jumped on the bandwagon for competitive advantage: hence, if you do not pursue innovation, your competitors will make you obsolete someday, no product or business model has an eternal shelf life. Innovation has many dimensions: it creates value for existing customers, thereby letting you keep your current market share; it creates value for new customers, enabling you to get growth; it enables you to work with new processes to access a lower cost base; supplier innovation enables you to leverage partners’ innovation capabilities to offer value to customers, and capture value for yourself. So the notion of continuous improvement is indeed extendable to continuous innovation, the business world in all sectors moves on a treadmill; the pace of the treadmill is faster in some industries like technology and fashion, and slower in some other industries. Innovation is the lever that enables you to keep pace on the treadmill if you are at the industry average; and enables you to set the pace if you innovate at a faster rate than the industry average. If you stand still on the treadmill or run at a slower pace than the treadmill in a competitive environment, at some stage, you will be thrown off the treadmill.\n\nThis course should be of particular interest to people aspiring for a career in designing and managing for innovation, either directly (e.g., V.P. of R&D, R&D Manager) or indirectly (e.g., management consulting). The course will also be useful to SME proprietors and entrepreneurs who intend to serve new markets, or use new technologies, or participants who wish to strategically reposition their offerings in an existing market. The course should also be of interest to people who manage interfaces between innovation and business functions such as finance, marketing, managerial accounting and human resources. This course introduces the student to ‘the front end of innovation’. We will explore the practice of innovation, and we will also apply the techniques and principles of innovation that will step through the ideation and opportunity recognition ‘front end’ of innovation. The tools that support it are a powerful process that can improve product, service and experience concepts (selected applications to products and services will be covered). The course will cover theories of innovation management and how to make organizations more innovative. We will introduce participants to the concept of Creativity being the front end of innovation. The theoretical background that we will use for Creativity will be the Innovator’s Method Model by Furr and Dyer, the Innovator’s DNA model created by Dyer, Gregersen and  Christensen, and the ideas of creativity enhancement challenges by IDEO and taught by the Stanford Design School. We will first elicit definitions of creativity and innovation from the participants, followed by a number of interactive exercises for enhancing creativity that were designed by IDEO. Overall, we will have interactive exercises and tools for most of the sessions, all the creativity challenges are tools for enhancing creativity, as shown by the Stanford Design School. They key message will be the correspondence between creativity and divergent thinking. We will show that the creativity aspect of individuals in hindered by various cognitive biases, we will define and explore these biases.\n\nManaging innovation and growth is challenging, as innovation can be driven by multiple facets. Business innovation can be classified into three kinds: (i) innovation of the core products and services that are offered to customers, called product or service innovation. This is the most commonly understood kind of innovation, the firm can either create improved variants of existing products and services, giving them a competitive advantage in the current industry scenario; or it can create radically new products and services that create new markets. The Apple iMac comes out with new variants all the time that are faster and lighter, this would be an example of an innovation that gives you a competitive advantage in an existing market. The iPad created a new market, in that it was somewhere between a mobile phone and a laptop, the phablet would be an example of a product that created a new market. (ii) innovations in the design of the supply chain enable the firm to lower its cost base, leverage the innovative capabilities of its suppliers, and get its products and services to your customers faster and at lower cost. Toyota’s well-known Keiretsu model is a good example of process or supply chain innovation, that lowers the cost of delivery, and improves service levels simultaneously. Finally, (iii) innovations at the interface of the firm with their suppliers and consumers enables customers to provide more value to their customers, and capture more value for themselves, by matching supply and demand better. Zara’s famed agile model, where they design and produce small batches to understand customer preferences and then scale production of bestsellers has enabled them to get a significant market and cost advantage, Zara is the world’s biggest apparel seller today. This course has a large emphasis on hands-on learning, using simulations and classroom exercises to give the participant a better idea of advancements in innovations and growth. The course gives the participant an overview of the issues of innovation and growth management in a wide variety of industries, including digital businesses.  After completing the course, the student should be able to characterize the innovation and growth issues in an industry/firm, evaluate current practice and identify improvement opportunities for making innovation sustainable using resources on a global scale."

Japan, China, and India represent the historical nexus in Asia, each having their own challenges for foreign businesses to penetrate. But what has been gaining the attention of business has been the emergence of the ASEAN region – an opportunity represented by over 600 million people, a population greater than Europe, which will become the fourth largest economy in the world by 2030. Comprising Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar, Malaysia, Cambodia, Laos, Singapore, and Brunei (ordered by population size), ASEAN is the fourth largest export trading region in the world. However, economic development across ASEAN is extremely diverse with the spread of per capita income being a factor 24x between the richest country, Singapore, versus the poorest, Cambodia.\n\nThis course will equip the student with an appreciation of the historical influences on the social-political-economic structures of the countries within Asia, with an emphasis on ASEAN.

In 2008, for the first time, more people lived in urban areas than rural areas. In 1950, 30 per cent of the world’s population was urban, and by 2050, 66 per cent of the world’s population is projected to be urban (based on the forecast of 9 billion people).

        "institution": "SMU",
        "description": "Family firms are ubiquitous in many economies. Half of the 30 largest firms in 27 developed economies are family-owned. In the S&P 500, 40% are family firms. In the Asia Pacific, family firms are estimated to comprise 85% of commercial businesses.\n\nSince family owners usually have long-standing ties with local communities, family firms are also strong proponents of community impact and local causes. As wealth owners, family members also have the potential to deploy private capital in commercial investments, as well as towards broader causes in the philanthropic and impact space. Business families thus play a critical role in the sustainability agenda through their operating businesses as well as in their private capacity.\n\nFamily firms differ from the typical MNC in terms of their links to the family’s legacy, values, organizational structure, processes, and dynamics. Thus, a different set of management tools and frameworks are required to lead family firms and to advise family owners in their approach to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) concerns.\n\nThis course is structured around 3 themes with a focus on Asian family firms: 1) Sustainable family business, 2) Environmental and social impact, 3) Governance and succession. Through case studies, guest speakers, and interactive discussions, the course will equip students with the conceptual frameworks to a) understand the dynamics of family-ownership in Asia, and b) apply the structures, tools, and techniques to enable next-gen leaders and advisors to family firms in the pursuit of sustainability goals."

In 2008, for the first time, more people lived in urban areas than rural areas. In 1950, 30 per cent of the world’s population was urban, and by 2050, 66 per cent of the world’s population is projected to be urban (based on the forecast of 9 billion people). In this scenario, the UN projects that humans will consolidate into 41 megacity regions by 2030.\n\n• Indeed, these challenges create a multitude of opportunities for business who have the chance to offer innovative solutions for our future. Of course, the complexity of the problem calls for a systemic approach based on new technologies, new business models, new approaches to planning, financing and policy making.\n\n• This module will address the topic of the future of cities by focusing on forecasts, experts’ opinions, case studies and industry insights.\n\n• Since this module is a Glocal Elective, the topics will be discussed from a global perspective.\n\n• The application, execution and transformation of ‘smart cities’ will focus on Singapore as a global best practice exemplar."

        "description": "This new MST course rests on the assumption that there is a powerful synergy between sustainability and innovation in business and society. The term ‘sustainable innovation’ refers to the creation of new market space, products and services or processes driven by social, environmental or sustainability concerns. Just like general innovation, sustainable innovation goes way beyond incremental improvements of products, services, or processes. The challenge is to proactively embrace risk management and sustainability considerations (environmental, social, financial) aimed at aligning (novel) business strategies with the Sustainable Development Goals to create and capture new value. If governed well by results-oriented, socially aware sustainability leaders embedded in a ‘good’ governance structure, sustainable innovation governance results not only in greater effectiveness at (intra)organisational levels but also helps to create a cleaner, healthier, fairer (and hopefully more stable) world as envisaged by the circular economy. The urgent need for enhanced sustainability innovation governance has never been greater as evidenced by rapid population growth, pollution, (toxic) waste, plastic accumulating in our oceans, limited natural resources, climate change etc. This course will introduce students to the dos and don’ts of integrating sustainability into business practice based on effective policies, processes and frameworks, board governance, senior management strategy, and stakeholder management. Several case studies of for-profit and nonprofit organisations such as City Development Limited (CDL), DBS, SIA, Eco Ark, and others will be featured to appreciate what it takes to make sustainable innovation governance work."

Marketers serve a vital role in the long-term success of all organizations, profit-oriented as well as not-for-profit, small as well as large.

It also aims to develop students’ ability to develop a strategic plan, beginning with an analysis of situation, the selection of the right target segments and the right competitive advantages, to the formulation of a coherent set of marketing actions that contribute to the company’s goals. A problem-solving approach is taken in the course, with the view that an effective solution to a marketing problem requires a thorough understanding of the consumer/market and of the competitive context.\n\nThis course is suitable not just for marketing majors, but anyone who has an understanding of basic marketing concepts and who wishes to have a good understanding of how strategic marketing can contribute to a company’s success."

Students will cover this course under two parallel themes–the process of selling and the role of the professional sales team through the process of sales management. Students will learn the underlying body of marketing theory that underpins the study of sales management and personal selling. You will also learn some of the important principles of effective presentations related to sales proposals to organizational customers. A key delivery for this course would be for students to develop a case scenario to simulate a sales strategy involving target prospect calling, sales presentation and negotiations leading to sales conversion. The sales management course is focused on consumer trade marketing (pushing products through the channel) as well as business-to-business marketing applications for sales of business products and services to corporate customers."

Instead, the best marketers understand that customers do not behave rationally and that even the best plans are constantly fine-tuned. Most importantly, great marketing provides a framework that creates a bias for action , not a bias for never-ending analysis and planning. Results only come when you actually try something, not think about trying something."

The popular mantra applies here: “all elements of the marketing mix have the capacity to communicate.” Major changes primarily impacted by the use of the digital media as well as the global impact of messaging in marketing needs to be strongly factored in today’s study of marketing communications. Ultimately, the end outcome of IMC is its impact on the brand in terms of its ability to elevate brand awareness, brand recognition and ultimately brand preference and loyalty.

The key to success is thought to lie in thoroughly understanding what these needs and wants are and ensuring the best fit between what is offered as a product and what is desired. This market-led approach, unfortunately, is myopic in its neglect of other stakeholders, such as the environment and the community. This course takes an alternative perspective, premised on climate change, deterioration of the marine ecosystem, and social inequalities as realities. It first examines how current consumption patterns are harming the environment and communities. It then delves into what responsible consumption entails and how consumers can be influenced to make product choices that are sustainable. Theories in psychology will be drawn on to provide that understanding of consumer behaviour. The course will also examine what companies can do to ensure that their marketing activities are aligned with sustainability goals. Case studies of companies with strong sustainability initiatives will be used to illuminate current best practices."

        "description": "Marketing activity is the core of an operating business.   It provides the managerial focus for interfacing with customers and the source of intelligence about customers, competitors, and the general environment.  Managers must identify and measure consumers’ needs and wants, assess the competitive environment, select the most appropriate customer targets and then develop marketing programs that satisfy consumers’ needs better than the competition. Further, marketing focuses on the long-run relationship of a company to its customers as well as short- run sales and profits.\nAfter three decades in which information technology (IT) was viewed by most senior executives as belonging solely to the “back office” of accounting and hum-drum transaction processing, IT has broken out. In many executive suites today, the talk now turns to the Internet, to electronic commerce, to knowledge management to network economy and to the issues involved in utilizing IT for “business transformation.” Understanding the new economy, which is at the interface of technology, economics and marketing is essential in successfully managing businesses in the future.\nIt is clear that, in an increasingly competitive global world, businesses must transform themselves to be more productive, to gather and store customer and competitive information and to capture the “tacit” knowledge that each employee holds in his/her head. Large software companies such as SAP, i2, and Oracle tout the potential to transform operations, supply chains, and customer relationships. A successful implementation of one of their software can provide new or better information to an organization’s decision makers, and enable global manufacturing and distribution processes. On the other hand, botched implementations can stymie product and service deliveries and prove extremely costly in at least the short term.\nFirms are transforming their entire supply chain. At one end of the supply chain, companies like GE and major automobile manufacturers are demanding that all their suppliers interact with through the Internet. On the other end of the value chain, both Internet start-up companies and more established brick-and-mortar firms are enabling customers throughout the world to buy from them through the Internet. Increasingly, firms are enabling their customers to look into their internal systems to assess when orders will be delivered.\nIndustries themselves are rapidly changing form and business methods. The music industry, for example,  because  of  MP3,  (even  after)  Napster,  peer-to-peer  networks  (like  Gnutella, LimeWire) and Apple’s iPod and iTunes has undergone major transformation. More music is sold on-line than on CDs (Independent, may 12, 2012; http://www.independent.co.uk/arts- entertainment/music/news/more-music-downloads-sold-than-cds-7807443.html ). Amazon now sells more eBooks than printed books (BBC, August 6, 2012; http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19148146 ). New services have been created, some successful, such as on-line auctions (eBay, Ariba) and some not so successful such as grocery store delivery (Webvan). Partnerships and alliances are forming among former competitors, like competitors in technology services or transportation, in order to provide end-to-end services to large customers. New companies have emerged which have changed the way we communicate and share (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest) and pay (PayPal, Square). Google has led the way to monetize search (96% of its $39 billion revenue now comes from online advertising; http://venturebeat.com/2012/01/29/google-advertising/ ).\nOne of the main objectives of this course is to provide you with an understanding of the strategic marketing issues faced by firms in the network economy, with special emphasis on how this has affected traditional and technology firms. This course should equip you with conceptual frameworks and analytical tools required to understand the new economy and manage fast paced traditional and technology businesses."

Social network ad spend will reach $11 billion in 2014, 62% of it will be spent on Facebook (eMarketer, November 2012). \n\nThis new media presents many challenges to marketing professionals. Where once much of the ad spend devoted to traditional media was typically one way (i.e. from the firm to the consumer), the explosion of social media demands a two way conversation. The increasing use of user generated content and the platforms that facilitate their influence means that the firm does not have control on what messages are being circulated about the firm and its brands. Understanding the digital technologies, the social media tools and the mechanisms by which consumers get influenced is important in developing future marketing communication strategies.

Thus, a clear understanding of the principles, concepts, and results of consumer behavior is critical to success in marketing. However, while all of us are\nourselves consumers, our intuitions about our own behavior as well as that of other consumers are unfortunately often inaccurate. This over-reliance on our own intuition has led managers astray, resulting in poor managerial\ndecision making for their organizations.\n\nThe purpose of this course is to help students gain insights into the principles and processes of consumer behavior. In doing so, students will be able to use their understanding of consumer behavior to evaluate and develop effective marketing strategies. To achieve these learning objectives, in this course we will directly\nexamine extant theory and research concerning the behavior of the consumer, with the goal of understanding how marketing managers can use these ideas to design their marketing programs. Knowledge of consumer behavior requires an understanding of important theoretical concepts from related fields such as psychology, sociology, economics, etc. Given the nature of the subject, while marketing applications will be discussed throughout the course, this course will be heavier on theory compared to other marketing courses."

        "description": "Marketing activity is the core of an operating business.   It provides the managerial focus for interfacing with customers and the source of intelligence about customers, competitors, and the general environment.  Managers must identify and measure consumers’ needs and wants, assess the competitive environment, select the most appropriate customer targets and then develop marketing programs that satisfy consumers’ needs better than the competition. Further, marketing focuses on the long-run relationship of a company to its customers as well as short- run sales and profits.\nAfter three decades in which information technology (IT) was viewed by most senior executives as belonging solely to the “back office” of accounting and hum-drum transaction processing, IT has broken out. In many executive suites today, the talk now turns to the Internet, to electronic commerce, to knowledge management to network economy and to the issues involved in utilizing IT for “business transformation.” Understanding the new economy, which is at the interface of technology, economics and marketing is essential in successfully managing businesses in the future.\nIt is clear that, in an increasingly competitive global world, businesses must transform themselves to be more productive, to gather and store customer and competitive information and to capture the “tacit” knowledge that each employee holds in his/her head. Large software companies such as SAP, i2, and Oracle tout the potential to transform operations, supply chains, and customer relationships. A successful implementation of one of their software can provide new or better information to an organization’s decision makers, and enable global manufacturing and distribution processes. On the other hand, botched implementations can stymie product and service deliveries and prove extremely costly in at least the short term.\nFirms are transforming their entire supply chain. At one end of the supply chain, companies like GE and major automobile manufacturers are demanding that all their suppliers interact with through the Internet. On the other end of the value chain, both Internet start-up companies and more established brick-and-mortar firms are enabling customers throughout the world to buy from them through the Internet. Increasingly, firms are enabling their customers to look into their internal systems to assess when orders will be delivered.\nIndustries themselves are rapidly changing form and business methods. The music industry, for example,  because  of  MP3,  (even  after)  Napster,  peer-to-peer  networks  (like  Gnutella, LimeWire) and Apple’s iPod and iTunes has undergone major transformation. More music is sold on-line than on CDs (Independent, may 12, 2012; http://www.independent.co.uk/arts- entertainment/music/news/more-music-downloads-sold-than-cds-7807443.html ). Amazon now sells more eBooks than printed books (BBC, August 6, 2012; http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19148146 ). New services have been created, some successful, such as on-line auctions (eBay, Ariba) and some not so successful such as grocery store delivery (Webvan). Partnerships and alliances are forming among former competitors, like competitors in technology services or transportation, in order to provide end-to-end services to large customers. New companies have emerged which have changed the way we communicate and share (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest) and pay (PayPal, Square). Google has led the way to monetize search (96% of its $39 billion revenue now comes from online advertising; http://venturebeat.com/2012/01/29/google-advertising/ ).\nOne of the main objectives of this course is to provide you with an understanding of the strategic marketing issues faced by firms in the network economy, with special emphasis on how this has affected traditional and technology firms. This course should equip you with conceptual frameworks and analytical tools required to understand the new economy and manage fast paced traditional and technology businesses."

If marketing is to be effective in meeting the CEO and Board level challenges, then marketing has to become:\n\n• more strategic, more cross-functional, and more bottom-line oriented\n• effective in the face of new competitors like retailers, low cost rivals, and emerging giants\n• help the transition to new channels and new media\n\nOur focus will be on the business unit and its network of suppliers, channels, customer relationships, and alliances. Taking the viewpoint of the CEO and the general manager, the course will focus on three over-riding themes: \n\n- Successful marketing strategies deliver superior customer value; \n- Successful implementation of these strategies requires orchestrating the entire value network and marketing mix in an effective and consistent manner; and \n- Marketing innovation can be used as a driver for changing the existing rules of the game in an industry."

Given its wide applicability and relevance, behavioural science has gained immense popularity in the last few years in its study and effective application in business contexts. In particular, the success of many companies and non-profit organizations—from Apple, BMW, Coca Cola, Disney, to Zara—lies in uncovering insights into the minds,hearts, and behaviours of their target consumers. These behavioural insights are based on what science tells us about systematic patterns in the behaviour of people in taking actions, making decisions, and forming intentions.\n\nIn this course, we will take a deeper look at the role behavioural science plays in people’s path to action, whether it be search, evaluation, purchase behaviour, or more. We will examine how brands and companies leverage the theories and principles of behavioural science to shape, shift, or even completely disrupt people’s preferences in marketing contexts—with the aim to better achieve marketing objectives and positively impact the bottom line. We will also discuss the tools to implement and measure the impact of behavioral science. To achieve these learning objectives, in this course we will directly examine extant theory, research, and scientific findings concerning the behaviour of individuals, with the goal of understanding how marketing managers can use these ideas to design their products, advertising, and marketing programs."

This call for responsiveness comes from not just consumers, but also employees, the government and society at large.\n\nA major driver of these issues is how much the world consumes and the type of products that are manufactured and consumed. Marketing has a significant role to play in tackling sustainability problems and it behooves marketers to equip themselves with the knowledge and skills that will enable them to be mindful and responsible marketers. Increasingly this will be a charge for marketers in all firms, large and small – B2C and B2B, local and international – to be sensitive to the environmental impact of all a marketer does.\n\nThe first half of the course examines the social and environmental impact of current consumption patterns and looks at how consumers can be influenced to make product choices that are sustainable. Theories in psychology will be drawn upon in looking at ways to change consumer behaviour and in examining the relationship between consumption and wellbeing.\n\nThe second half of the course looks at how traditional marketing tools can be modified and how new tools can be effectively applied to market sustainable products more effectively. For example, it delves into how a product can be designed, promoted, priced and distributed to mitigate its environmental impact over its entire life cycle (from supply chain to disposal). Case studies of companies with strong sustainability initiatives will be used to illuminate current best practices."

        "institution": "SMU",
        "description": "Traditionally, consumer behaviour research can be roughly divided into two approaches. One approach takes an “Information Processing” (“IP”) perspective. In this perspective, the focus is on how/what consumers pay attention to, how they learn, how memory works in storing/retrieving information, and how this information affects consumers’ attitudes, purchase intentions, and so on. There is thus a strong emphasis on the psychological underpinnings—such as memory structures and processes—and on their impact on persuasion and attitudes. \n\nThe second approach takes a “Judgment and Decision Making” perspective and is generally referred to as Behavioral Decision Theory (“BDT”). In this approach, the focus is to compare how one should behave (i.e., normative behavior) against how one actually behave(i.e., descriptive behaviour).  There is thus a strong emphasis on the “outcome” variable of consumer judgment and decision making process—such as judgments, choices, and decisions—and attempts to chronicle and explain how such behaviour deviate from normative behaviour.\n\nOur course will introduce you to these two common approaches in consumer behaviour research. In the first part of the course we will be devoting our attention to understanding the “process” variables in consumer behavior through the IP perspective. In the second part of the course we will be looking at the “outcome” variables of consumer behaviour through the BDT perspective. Finally, in the last part of the course we will turn our attention to some of the contemporary topics in consumer behaviour research."

The primary objective of the course is to provide such students with the concepts and tools needed for collecting and analyzing behavioral data.  A secondary objective is to provide these future academic reviewers the foundations for the methodological evaluation of other behavioral researchers' work.  The course thus covers the designs and analyses that are most often used by experimental researchers in the following fields: marketing, organizational behavior, and psychology.  Topics include: factorial designs, repeated (within-subject) and mixed designs, fractional (e.g., Latin squares) designs, analysis of covariance, etc.\n\nWe will examine these designs and analyses from the perspective of an applied behavioral researcher, not from that of a statistician.  That is, we will emphasize the actual use of proper data collection procedures and analysis techniques for rigorous (i.e., publishable) theory testing.  Although there will be sufficient coverage of statistical concepts (to ensure that the procedures and techniques are applied intelligently), we will not focus on statistical theory per se (as would related courses in a statistics department).\n\nIn addition to the objectives mentioned above, the course will offer students an opportunity to get started with the use of SAS, one of the most widely used statistical programming languages for manipulating and analyzing data.  While this will not be a course on SAS itself, students should become comfortable with this platform by the end of the course.  This comfort will eventually allow them to move on to more complex applications using SAS (or similar languages)."

The underlying philosophy of this seminar is that the gains of interdisciplinary and multi-method research far outweigh the pain and inconveniences associated with leaving one’s “comfort zone.” Thus, for example, we will discuss how substantive marketing issues (e.g., reward programs, choice-set effects in retail, crowdfunding, product assortments) could benefit from an interdisciplinary marriage of methods (e.g., experiments and process measures, secondary data analysis, econometric and theoretical modeling). We will also read and analyse various articles that apply consumer behaviour insights on marketing practice.\n\nBesides examining prior work and highlighting the benefits of cross-disciplinary research, the goal of this seminar is to improve your ability to identify interesting research questions and develop effective methods for testing them. In each session there will be a few required articles that will be analysed in detail. In addition, for most sessions there will be several additional background readings. While these additional readings are not mandatory, they are highly recommended as a starting point should you develop interest in that specific substantive area.\n\nClass sessions will involve different components. We will, of course, discuss the assigned articles. When you read each of the assigned paper, make your own notes and write down questions. Try to understand (1) what is the research question being addressed, (2) what is the methodology used (and why it was chosen), (3) what are the main findings, (4) what are some possible alternative explanations to the results, and (5) how the research can be improved or extended (i.e., directions for future research). In some sessions, students will identify research ideas that build on the issues raised in the articles. The class will also develop methodologies for testing identified research ideas. In addition, you will be asked to e-mail the instructors (prior to every class) a brief bullet-point commentary on each article (further details will be given during our first meeting).\n\nFinally, each student will be expected to write a paper presenting an original research idea and including the following: \n• Very brief and very relevant literature review;\n• Detailed conceptualisation and hypotheses generation;\n• Detailed operationalisation and method;\n\n• A stylised model, capturing the essence of the studied phenomenon (note: you need to show that this model is empirically testable) and;\n• Very brief discussion. You will be asked to discuss and present your research idea in class (see class schedule). The instructor’s approval for the topic and general methodology of the research is required. The paper is due by in Week 15 and should not exceed 20 pages (tables, figures, and references included). Your final course grade will be based on class participation (40%), the brief article commentaries (10%), preliminary proposal #1 (5%), preliminary proposal #2 (5%), and the research paper (40%)."

This course will directly help students in the execution of their research projects, in handling reviewer comments, and may help them to come up with novel research ideas. Students will gain hands-on experience in applying the methods discussed.\n\nThe course starts by introducing students to the various sources of quantitative data that may be encountered in marketing. More specifically, the course will cover questionnaire and experimental data, novel types of data such as data from eye tracking and text mining, and sources of secondary data such as consumer panels and scanner data. In addition, the differences between cross-sectional, temporal, and panel data will be discussed. Finally, the link will be made between the different sources and types of data and causality. Then, the focus will shift to data analysis. The data analysis part of Empirical Marketing Models will start with an introduction to SPSS and basic hypothesis testing. Next, regression models will be discussed. Students will gain hands-on experience in specifying and estimating linear additive and multiplicative marketing models, both in SPSS and in Stata, and will learn how to derive elasticities. Next, common problems, and their solutions, will be discussed, including multicollinearity, endogeneity, serial correlation, and heteroscedasticity. Given that marketing data often comes in the form of panel data, e.g., transaction data for many customers over time, students will be introduced to random and fixed effects panel data models. Binary logistic regression models will form the next topic to allow students to analyse such variables as purchase incidence or coupon redemption. For new products no sales data are available. Conjoint analysis will be discussed as a solution to this problem. Cluster and factor analysis, two forms of multivariate data analysis, will be the next topics. Cluster analysis, or unsupervised machine learning, is an important tool for creating customer segments, and factor analysis is important when working with a (too) large number of correlated variables. Empirical Marketing Models will end with a discussion of various new developments in marketing models."

The course focuses on both the theoretical and applied literature on knowledge-based society/economy, knowledge work(ers) and knowledge management. Several case studies will be analysed aimed at illustrating the challenges managers experienced who tried to find answers to the issue raised above as well as to outline the benefits and consequences of ‘good’ KM."

Importantly, teams are not only the work horses of organizations, but they are increasingly used to tackle the most important and strategic issues facing organizations.  Teams are charged with making important decisions, developing innovations, and solving complex problems. Thus, being able to develop and maintain high-performance teams is a crucial success factor for organizations. For individuals, their value to an organization depends to a large extend on how well they function as members and leaders of teams. Importantly team leadership is increasingly expected from all members of a team, rather than being tied to a specific official role; and team roles are becoming more and more fluid and situational. Moreover, organizations employ various types of teams, such as virtual teams, calling for increasing sophistication from their employees. The purpose of this course is to expose students to these issues and to make them familiar both with research and theory on teams as well as to increase their competency to work and lead in teams. Topics include team performance, team development, team innovation, team decision making, conflict in teams, and types of teams."

At the minimum, this ensures that your legal obligations surrounding employees are always met. Yet, its importance extends far beyond legal compliance – employment law considerations are also vital in informing strategic management decisions across key areas, from workforce planning (e.g. cross-border recruitment, restructuring/downsizing), ESG performance (e.g. managing diversity and inclusion, workplace safety, grievances), risk management (e.g. protecting company assets, managing dispute resolution), stakeholder relations (e.g. managing unions), to expansion into new markets (e.g. navigating local laws).\n\nIn this regard, this course is designed to impart to you an understanding of the employment law regime in Singapore. You will acquire an awareness of the employment landscape and key employment-related laws in Singapore. You will learn to identify and address key issues that impact employment and affect employment relationships. You will develop a working understanding of the key ‘buckets’ of employment law, from hiring, managing, terminating, to post-termination matters. You will develop an appreciation of how these legal requirements not only apply to daily operational issues, but also how they form the crucial basis for higher-level strategic management decisions. You will hence study requirements and issues relating to the following non-exhaustive list of topics:\n\n• Hiring employees, including looking at fair hiring guidelines on non-discriminatory and ‘locals-first’ policies in Singapore; and hiring of foreign manpower;\n• Managing employees, including looking at employers’ and employees’ rights and obligations under law; employment contracts, including what they comprise and how they govern an employment relationship; and workplace safety and health matters, an area under significant scrutiny following COVID-19;\n• Terminating employees, including whether and how employees can be dismissed from the workplace; how retrenchment exercises work; and the respective pitfalls;\n• Industrial relations, including how they affect the hiring, managing and termination phases of the employment relationship; and\n• Post-termination concerns, including confidentiality and non-competition/solicitation obligations. \n\nThrough the course, you will be exposed to the different sources of employment law, including legislation, case law, tripartite guidelines, advisories issued by the Ministry of Manpower, amongst others. You will understand how the tripartite relationship between the Government, employers and unions work and affect these. In this respect, this is a very grounded course, which will require you to develop a clear understanding of the employment legal regime and then think practically on how to anticipate, manage, and navigate employment issues, as well as apply them to broader organizational objectives.\n\nThis course will be especially pertinent to students aspiring to careers as a HR professional or in management. In either role, a firm grasp of employment law means that you will be able to proactively identify and flag potential issues, hence becoming a valued strategic partner to your employer. The course will also be relevant to students who are interested in consulting work or business in general."

The organizations that will win the “war for talent” will be those which are better at identifying and keeping key talent, motivating high performance, developing and promoting staff and predicting future people needs accurately. HR professionals need analytics to address these challenges. For exam-ple, linking pay-for-performance has been a dogma of management, but recent research shows that most incentive plans do not produce the desired behavior, and that pay, in fact, has little correlation to business results.\n\nTo succeed in the business world, it is imperative that HR provide data-driven answers and insights on how to implement and execute strategy through the people in the organization. The course provides students with practi-cal, hands-on approaches to connect HR policies and practices to business performance. You will review key statis-tics and finance concepts, such as ROI and people productivity; become familiar with available tools such as Workday and Tableau to complement Excel and others; discuss data collection, clean-up and warehousing; prac-tice building descriptive and predictive models; and get hands-on experience in applications for workforce planning, recruitment, compensation, training, career planning and turnover.

However, it can be extremely challenging for leaders to manage teams effectively in today’s diverse, digital and dynamic times. This course examines the design, management, and leadership of teams in organizational settings and focuses on more than just formal team leadership as all team members can play leadership roles in teams. This is an advanced course which builds on and extends foundational knowledge learnt in OBHR101 with a specific focus on group dynamics. It provides detailed knowledge of how group and intergroup dynamics affect both individual functioning but also organisation-level outcomes. The emphasis is understanding the interpersonal processes and structural characteristics that influence the effectiveness of teams, the dynamics of intra-team relationships, and sharing of knowledge and information in teams. This course is designed to provide you with perspectives and skills that will help you to develop and manage high impact teams. Topics include understanding the foundations of high performing teams, decision-making in teams, managing team conflict; team creativity and innovation; leading diverse and virtual teams, among others."

This course is designed to be relevant to a broad spectrum of negotiation problems that are faced by managers and professionals. It is also designed to complement the technical and diagnostic skills that are learned in other courses at the SMU. A basic premise of this course is that while managers need analytical skills to develop optimal solutions to problems, they also require a broad array of negotiation skills for these solutions to be accepted and implemented.

Yet, for any change initiative to gain traction and develop into a major change, it first needs to be successfully implemented at the work unit. Hence, this course is designed to equip you with the science and art of leading and managing change from the grassroots. To this end, the course content is tailored to traverse three key elements of organizational change: 1) micro-processes (focused on the change agent), 2) meso-processes (focused on collective action), and 3) macro-processes (focused on the organizational and institutional environment). We unpack these key elements with an emphasis on the “how” of change – e.g., how do you speak up for yourself and others; how do you bring change proposals to life; how do you leverage resistance; how do you involve allies; how do you navigate mandated change?\n\nIn line with this focus on the “how” of change, we will draw on our experiences, case discussions, exercises, simulations, and practitioner-oriented literature to derive pragmatic insights on leading and managing change. Thus, analysis and discussion of your own and your classmates’ change initiatives are a central component to the course. In particular, given the importance of “learning by doing,” this course will be most valuable for students who are currently working on a change project or are about to undertake one."

This course is divided into two sections that cover (1) research methods used to generate rigorous evidence and (2) analytical methods used to generate insights for HC decisions. \n\nResearch methods represent the “how” of the scientific study of theoretical and applied questions. Appropriate research methods allow us to rigorously investigate and develop evidence to address important problems. This section of the course is an introductory master-level seminar on empirical research methods in the context of business research. It will focus on different types of research designs and methods, such as lab experiments, field experiments, and survey research. It is meant to help students make informed choices about designing and conducting their own research studies effectively and ethically.\n\nHC analytics focuses on the use of people data for HC decisions and it involves mapping HC initiatives to business outcomes.  The key benefits of employing HC analytics include quantifying returns on HC investments and optimizing employee investments to achieve tangible business outcomes. However, the challenge faced by HC practitioners lies in knowing what to analyze and how to analyze.  Reports have revealed that only a small percentage of HC practitioners are proficient in undertaking advanced univariate analyses and that an even fewer number can perform advanced multivariate analyses.  This proficiency gap suggests a need for HC practitioners to be more competent in this field. The focus of this section of the course is to narrow this gap, allowing HC professionals to play a more strategic role within their organizations through equipping them with the ability to undertake some useful HC analytics on available organizational employee data.

While many organisations understand the need for innovation leadership and governance, the effectiveness of leadership for innovation - broadly speaking – varies greatly. Central to effective innovation leadership and governance are effective leaders with the right abilities who can match their competencies with the respective innovation situation they find themselves in. In this course, we will explore this challenge with the help of various theoretical frameworks and empirical studies to appreciate what it takes to avoid the classical traps of making innovation work in organisations in terms of strategy, process, structure, culture, skills and so forth. The course structure features alternating session units aimed at (i) internalising relevant concepts and frameworks as well as (ii) knowing how innovation practitioners lead and govern innovation efforts in real organisational contexts based on class discussions led by students and selected guests.\n\nBy the end of this course, students will be able to:\n\n• Appreciate the important role of leadership and governance in fostering innovation and creativity\n• Know what it takes to be an effective innovation leader   \n• Understand key innovation leadership principles and terms\n• Analyse and interpret existing empirical findings of innovation leadership studies\n• Apply key concepts, themes, and findings to various research paradigms and organisations"

While sometimes useful, such models can be considered micro-redescriptions rather than explanations of human behaviour. True explanations reference ultimate causation (why does jealousy exist?) and as such can at the same time lead to a profound understanding of who we are (revealing fundamental truths about human beings) as well as when and why we do what we do (thus improving on the traditional social science models predicting behaviour). The course will focus on key behaviours relevant to organisational life and the topics will also be partly customised around students’ interests."

        "description": "The purpose of this course is to help you better understand qualitative research methods so as to enable you to be a better researcher and reviewer of work that employs these types of methodologies. Given the breadth and variety of methods that fall under the rubric of “qualitative methods,” some classes will discuss general issues or skills that are applicable to several different methodological approaches (e.g., gaining access), while others will focus more specifically on a particular approach (e.g., ethnography).  You will notice that there is not a separate week on ethics.  Ethical treatment of those we study is crucial to all methodologies (quantitative and qualitative) – but ethical issues can be particularly acute in some forms of qualitative research.  As a result, we will integrate discussions of ethics throughout the course, and not relegate it to a weekly topic of discussion.\n\nQualitative methods courses in business schools are relatively rare. Ask most established qualitative researchers and they will talk about being trained using the apprenticeship model only. Taken together, this is both an exciting challenge and a daunting one – as there are few templates for such a course.  Consequently, your input will be essential in helping me refine and redesign the course as we go along. Thus, unlike other methods courses where you are “served” information, this course will be more like a “pot luck” with you bringing things to the class every week!\n\nThere will be at least two main avenues for learning in this class:\n\n1. Each week we will read and discuss what other researchers have written about a specific topic.  During the term, you will also do research on a specific methodology not covered in class. These will be the most “traditional” parts of class.\n\n2. There will be an “articles in the spotlight” each week. Selection of these articles was based on a variety of factors.  Many are award winning.  Most generally, I tried to pick articles that illustrate a specific methodological point (s) for a given week.  In addition to reading these articles for their theoretical content, we will discuss them in detail from a methodological standpoint. We will be addressing issues such as the following: “What makes this good (or bad) qualitative research?”  “What decisions did they have to make when deciding which information to include and which to leave out?”  “Was I convinced by the author’s (or authors’) arguments?”\n\nTo close, this course will be a lot of work -- but I also hope that it will also be enriching and fun!  By the time we are finished, you should have begun developing a unique skill set that should serve you well during graduate school and beyond."

        "institution": "SMU",
        "description": "This course focuses on a psychological (as opposed to structural or policy-based) approach to implementing positive interventions in organisations and societies. Psychological interventions directly influence individual psychology to promote wellbeing or performance. Examples of psychological interventions include such techniques as reflecting on a challenge in a positive light, purposefully thinking about one’s capabilities as something that can be grown and developed, or reflecting on one’s important values to reaffirm the self.\n\nPsychological interventions can often be implemented cheaply and on a large scale, and they have already been successfully used in fostering positive change in several key domains of social life, including exercise and weight loss (Samuel‐Hodge et al., 2009), marital quality (Finkel, Slotter, Luchies, Walton, & Gross, 2013), and environmentally friendly behaviour (Goldstein, Cialdini, & Griskevicius, 2008). Yet, psychological interventions are underutilised in organisations, and future generations of organisational researchers have an opportunity to leverage this approach to promote positive change, from inducing a higher sense of meaning at work, to reducing stress experienced by marginalised groups, and aiding the adjustment of such employees.\n\nWe will review foundational social psychological work on psychological interventions and learn about key theoretical principles. These will then be applied to four broad areas of key importance to organisations, and corresponding to student interest: implicit theories, coping, social cohesion, and emotion regulation. In the final session, we consider the role of technology (big data and algorithms) in applying as well as exploiting psychological intervention strategies."

Traditional theories have emphasized how work can contribute to human suffering, for example, through as alienation, stress, harassment, discrimination, and burnout. But work can also be a source of human flourishing. This aspect has been gaining more attention through developments such as scholarship on positive organizational scholarship, positive psychology, and mindfulness at work. In this course, we will critically discuss some of the important theoretical approaches, methods, and empirical findings on flourishing at work.

Without shipping, intercontinental trade, the bulk transport of raw materials, and the import/export of affordable food and manufactured goods would simply not be possible.  In fact, the standard container boxes are the bits and bytes that flow in today’s international trade network. Shipping logistics catalyzes the international supply chain management which deals with the management of physical goods (raw materials, components, finished products), information (orders, status, contracts), and financial flows (payment, credits, etc.) in a network of suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and customers. \n\nThis course examines the strategic role of shipping in global supply chains, and is an elective course which combines lectures, readings from the latest industry news, and case discussions.

Matching supply to demand is easiest when a firm has a flexible supply process, but flexibility is generally expensive. In this course we will learn (1) how to assess the appropriate level of supply flexibility for a given industry and (2) explore strategies for economically increasing a firm’s supply flexibility. Lastly we will study coordination and incentives across multiple firms in a supply chain. While tactical models and decisions are part of this course, the emphasis is on the qualitative insights needed by general managers or management consultants. We will demonstrate that companies can use (and have used) the principles from this course to significantly enhance their competitiveness."

Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss from operation failure.  Compared to other types of risk, such as credit, underwriting, and innovation risk, operational risk is perhaps the most fundamental and significant one. Why? Operational risk is highly asymmetrical in nature, because of the potential for very large losses due to extreme events (though these are usually few in number). Precisely because extreme events are so rare relative to other risk types, they are very difficult to assess. For organizations motivated by profit, a net positive return is required by shareholders. Operational risk therefore is a key concern of both internal and external stakeholders. \n\nThe course will give students an overview of which operational risks are prevalent in various industries and what tools and techniques can be used to identify, quantify and control operational risks. Besides learning the basics of probability and statistical theories, students will become familiar with the risk analysis framework and will conduct a risk analysis using either Oracle’s Crystal Ball software or @Risk from Palisade. Students will also be introduced to various regulatory requirements."

        "description": "A supply chain comprises firms, organizations, and individuals, linked through physical (material), information and financial flows, and whose activities enable products and services to be created and reach the consumers. In the last few decades, supply chain managers have reoriented their focus beyond the traditional logistics issues towards the development of integrated risk management approaches to handle the multiplicity and magnitude of risk factors in global supply chains. These risk factors include disruptions arising from natural and man-made disasters, technological innovations, fast-changing customer preferences, tight financial credit environments and fluctuating exchange rates and commodity prices. Building a functional supply chain requires careful planning and consideration of a variety of risks, and it is of paramount importance to integrate management of physical flows, information and financial flows in dealing with such risks. All logistics and supply chain organizations that effectively manage their supply chain risks enjoy a level of robustness and resilience that leads to unprecedented levels of operational excellence with all consequential advantages. The objective of this course is to provide a framework for supply chain risk management and to outline a portfolio of proven strategies to access, reduce, hedge, and mitigate supply chain risks."

These are the kinds of questions that students can find answers to in this project-based research design course. During the course students will learn how to write a rigorous empirical research paper and develop the methodological skills to survey public opinion and systematically code media content. After studying how to plan a content analysis and public opinion survey, students will work in groups and write a research proposal on a topic of their choosing. Potential topics are wide ranging. For instance, they could relate to elections, identity politics, migration, protest, conflict, as well as economic, business, environmental, health, or educational issues. Students then choose to design a survey or a content analysis. For the survey, students develop a questionnaire plan to gather public opinions on the media or preform a survey experiment to understand the impact of media. Students doing a content analysis will develop a codebook to code newspapers, TV, film, social media, or the web. After analyzing their unique data, student projects culminate in a presentation and an original research paper of approximately 9,000 words."

Since to early 1993, many of mainstays of the previous system have collapsed and new institutions have established: coalition government, electoral reform, the bubble economy, etc. Following the experience of ‘Japanese miracle,’ the second half of the twentieth century has seen South Korea transformed from an impoverished, war-ravaged nation to one of the most successful economies in East Asian region. This has been accompanied by a political transformation from a military authoritarian regime to a vibrant democracy.

In this new world, corporations increasingly deliver essential services and meet basic public needs, exert heavy influence over public policy and find that their consumers and investors hold them directly accountable for their effects on the environment and on human rights. This course examines how business, government, and society are responding to the changing landscape and explores the options that leaders now face, from rethinking business models to changing notions of governance. It focuses on the drivers for and obstacles to change, the different roles played by companies, governments, civil society, institutional investors and social entrepreneurs in shaping current approaches, and a sense of what the future may hold, particularly in Asia."

        "description": "Globalization is often associated with intensified cross-national flows of capital, commodities, and labor that elude state control and integrate local economies into global networks of production and trade.  This module examines the manifold dimensions of the global economy along three theoretical axes. First, the specific historical form of the global economy under study is “capitalism,” understood as not only an economic system of material production, distribution, and consumption but also a political order of power, authority, and legitimacy – in other words, a global political economy. Second, in analysing capitalism, we adopt a long historical view that traces the emergence of its fundamental logics and global expanse back to the eighteenth century. Third, we pay special attention to political and legal frameworks other than the nation-state, especially early-modern colonial empires, modern imperialism, and their institutional and ideological legacies that have endured into the post-war international regimes of production, trade, and development.\n\nThe aim is to provide a perspective on the political and historical dimensions of the global economy that is as multi-disciplinary as possible. Lectures and readings present material from international relations, economics, political science, history, sociology, anthropology, and geography. Although concepts and theories from economics and international political economy are central to this module, this is decidedly not a course in either international economics or the politics of economic relations among states. It is an investigation into a wider variety of forms and facets of politics as they pertain to the wide range of actors participating in the global economy."

Each week, we will concentrate on primary texts by canonical thinkers ranging from Plato to Foucault. In discussing the works of individual political philosophers, our objective is not to study each thinker’s thought for its own sake but to investigate the fundamental concepts and questions they brought to the fore. We will regularly ground the abstract ideas we examine in empirical phenomena, both past and present. This enterprise will involve textual interpretation and critical reflection in order to systematically scrutinize what we mean by “politics,” where we draw the boundaries of the “political,” and how we interrelate different political concepts and schemes."

This course examines the practical side of managing the global agenda. It addresses key questions: In the absence of an unlikely, and probably undesirable, world government, who makes and enforces global rules that could help humanity resolve these conundrums? Given the much-heralded rise of Asia, what roles are Asian governments (including Singapore) playing in these institutions, and should they do things differently? The course is highly interactive and puts a premium on student-led sessions. \n\nNo pre-requisites.

We will problematize this view of the economy through a historical survey of Western social thought on central economic concepts and questions, such as property, exchange, labor, production, distribution, and consumption. This historical perspective reveals that economic problems are never purely economic but have always been entwined with political issues and ethical judgments. As we examine a range of social and political theories by situating them in their historical contexts, we will analyze how questions of power, authority, and legitimacy, and conceptions of good life have been central to various definitions of the economy. We will see that processes of production and consumption, and institutions of property and markets are invariably implicated in profound controversies about justice, fairness, freedom, and equality. Grappling with diverse approaches to the economy, some of which are wildly different than today’s dominant theories, is intended to cultivate a critical distance toward our tacit assumptions and broaden the scope of questions we can ask about prevailing economic structures and processes."

With an overarching focus on contemporary environmental sustainability topics, the course allows students to explore questions about how different categories of policy instruments or tools that are part of governments’ public policy ‘toolkits’ are formulated, how they work and how they can be combined in order to address multifaceted problems of the environment. The course allows an examination the craft of policy design from a policy process perspective, namely: how public policy problems get framed and raised on government agendas, how different instruments are analysed, combined and chosen as solutions to these problems, how these instruments mixes are implemented and how their success at addressing policy goals gets evaluated. Students of the course will have the opportunity to analyse contemporary environmental policy cases and learn about the policy design experience from experts of the field who will be invited as guest speakers to the classroom.  Some topics that are covered in the course include: policy cycles; policy tool classifications; simple vs. complex tool mixes; policy instrument calibrations; procedural instruments; nudges and nodality tools; regulations and authority-based instruments; organizational tools and tools for co-production and collaborative government."

Religion, on the other hand, is rooted in ideology and ritual, and faith in things unseen. However, religion underpins not only most societies and cultures of Asia, but is also a key element in nation-state formation and identity. It wields formidable political clout. Furthermore, policy-making on religious matters is one of the most sensitive and contested areas of governance in contemporary Asia. In this course we will explore the rise and fall of the secularization thesis and the apparent rise of religiosity as a political force. We will closely examine and complicate the relationship between religion and the state, and we will explore ways in which religion impacts policy-making in seemingly ‘secular’ areas such as health-care, trade, and citizenship. We will examine the role of the state in managing religious diversity and multi-culturalism, touching also on its role in enforcing religious orthodoxy. Throughout this course we will seek to develop a nuanced and grounded understanding of the interplay between religion and policy in Asia."

Unfortunately, research shows that passive leisure is not restorative nor provides important ingredients to meaningful living. In this course, we examine people’s motivation to work and its reciprocal relationship with their pursuit of leisure.

        "description": "Since the seminal work of Fisher Black, Myron Scholes and Robert Merton in the early seventies, an elegant theory has been developed for efficient derivatives securities valuation. The concepts of arbitrage, martingales and numerical methods are the three pillars on which the theory and implementation of the valuation of derivative securities rests. Today, advanced financial modelling techniques, developed by collaboration between academics and practitioners, have fundamentally transformed the financial market landscape. The derivatives business alone is a multi-trillion-dollar market. The objective of this course is to provide students a first course in financial calculus and the modelling of financial derivatives.\n\nAlthough the main emphasis of this course is on models based on stochastic processes, we start with binomial trees to illustrate 3 key concepts: hedging, no-arbitrage, and risk-neutrality. This lays down the foundation for more advanced topics, including martingales, stochastic integrals, stochastic differential equations, Ito’s formula, change of measure etc. The insight that created this subject and led to the development of the field of financial derivatives is the pricing and hedging of vanilla European options. There are two main approaches – 1) stochastic calculus with partial differential equation and 2) probability theory with martingale pricing formula. Both will be covered in this course. The same framework has subsequently been applied to the pricing and hedging of other more exotic financial products. Regardless of the approach taken, the theory is based on the assumption on no-arbitrage, and hence strong emphasis is placed on the importance of hedging and dynamic replication.\n\nThis course is an interesting mix of finance and mathematics. Students will see that simple financial concepts like the no-arbitrage principle, coupled with careful mathematical reasoning, can lead to a sophisticated formulation of pricing and hedging framework. Students are encouraged to form a rigorous understanding of financial modelling, valuation techniques and hedging."

It then moves on to model the credit risk of defaultable bonds and pure vanilla swaps, which are often a significant part of a bank or financial institution's risk exposure and necessitates risk management and regulatory capital charge computations. \n\nIn addition to mathematical modeling of credit risks, this course also offers an industry-centric view of firmwide credit risk modeling and management, with focuses on collateralization and value adjustment methodologies, covering topics on discount curve construction, central clearing, Credit Support Annex (CSA), credit value adjustment (CVA), funding value adjustment (FVA), liquidity value adjustment (LVA) and debt value adjustment (DVA) alike. Importance of identifying and quantifying Wrong Way Risk (WWR) and Right Way Risk are also detailed. The course will be given from a practitioner’s perspective, where multiple scenario analysis and examples will be given for all of the concepts introduced."

Given the focus on the MSc program, the course will be taught with a quantitative bent. However, the overarching aim is to equip students with the key tools and a broad awareness of the key issues in the industry. It is targeted at students with a keen interest to join the asset management industry as a quantitative analyst or portfolio manager. The course will first look at the theoretical aspects of modern portfolio theory. Following that risk premia strategies at both the top-down asset class level and the bottom-up security selection level will be explored. Finally we examine alternative portfolio construction methods aiming to mitigate the shortfalls inherent in portfolios constructed by the classic mean-variance optimization approach. The course attempts to blend a combination of technical rigor, real life practice as well as insights from academic research. Some numerical implementation using software packages such as MATLAB, R or Python may be involved during project work.

The datasets finance researchers have at our disposal was unimaginable even only a few years ago: satellite images, credit card transactions, sensor data, web scrapes, sentiment from news and tweets, geolocation of cargos crossing the oceans, and the like. The size of financial data has experienced exponential growth. With computational resources becoming cheaper, these data can be analyzed in full to hunt for hidden patterns or relationships previously undetectable. In recent years, there is a growing need for data specialist with a strong background in financial and quantitative modelling to accelerate digital transformation in both the Singapore and global financial markets.\n\nUnlike most other big datasets, financial data is widely known to be extremely noisy with a weak signal-to-noise ratio. Many patterns uncovered are due purely to randomness. With the availability of advanced machine learning algorithms, financial data scientists with a deep knowledge of financial data properties are in demand. There is a surge of interest in exploring the application of machine learning to financial problem. For example, in 2019 JP Morgan assessed the feasibility of using AI for option pricing, while Hull (2020) explored using reinforcement learning to self-discover the dynamic delta hedging strategy for option pricing. UBS created Evidence Lab focusing in financial data science in 2017.

Sociologists have long grappled with the understanding of fashions and tastes as problems of cultural change and social stability. This course reviews classical and contemporary sociological writings and explores this literature with two guiding questions:\n\n•\tWhat drives fashion to change and fads to occur?  \n•\tHow can research on fashion and fad be usefully applied in the real world, from high-fashion to policy making, from marketing to economic planning? \nThe major topics explored include thresholds and tipping points, contagiousness and social diseases, information cascades, social class and the origins of taste, self-fulfilling prophesies, and theories of social networks. The course draws on a diverse range of case studies, including racial segregation, riots, high-fashion, economic bubbles, music preference and the diffusion of civil protest. \n\nStudents are advised to complete SOCG001 Understanding Societies before enrolling for this course."

But why do people come to feel so strongly about their national identities that they do not hesitate to denounce and even demonize foreigners? This question has important implications for Asia, where many nation-states are relatively young and forced to negotiate the competing demands for nation-building and regional integration. This course thus takes a sociological look at how national identity is socially constructed within the larger context of economic development, cultural practices, and domestic and international politics."

Alongside unemployment and underemployment, insecure employment such as contract work, and internships have become de rigueur, including for groups of people – such as highly educated workers – who used to be exempt from the vagaries of the labor market. This course will examine trends that have shifted work away from a cradle-to-grave, steady work which predominated in the 20th century. We will also study how experiences of unemployment, underemployment, and other non-standard work impacts people in their everyday lives. This class will center on questions such as: what does work look like now, for people across social classes?; what does the absence of steady work mean for personal relationships?; how does this insecurity impact their aspirations for themselves or for their children? We will draw on recent social science research on contemporary experiences of work the world over."

Sustainability transitions refer to deep systemic innovations in socio-technical and socio-economic systems for the provision of societal functions such as food, mobility, and energy (Köhler et al., 2019). The change in complex sociotechnical systems is usually confronted with conflicting economic and environmental goals, at least in certain phases of the transformation processes. By leveraging innovation, different countries in the Global South such as Indonesia can chart paths towards sustainable development that balance economic growth with environmental protection more coherently. At the same time, there has been a growing awareness in research and practice alike, that transformations to more sustainable societies can only be successful when they are inclusive. However, there are knowledge gaps in the domain of innovation for sustainability transitions (Tirado-Herreo & Fuller, 2021). Where sustainability transitions are happening, there is little data tracking progress and identifying areas/directions for accelerating sustainability transition. Addressing these knowledge gaps requires greater collaboration among different stakeholders to leverage their expertise and resources towards more effective and context-specific solutions tailored to the challenges and opportunities.\n\nThis course will allow students to focus on tackling sustainability challenges to help Asian private and public entities (the Client) to plan and strategize in pursuing sustainability transition.

        "description": "In this course, students will work in virtual global teams, with students from other universities, to develop a proposal for a corporate client. Students will develop essential skills to thrive in the modern workplace – they will explore virtual collaboration tools, hone their interpersonal and intercultural competence, and employ data storytelling principles to craft persuasive narratives for business proposals.\n\nIn the first half of the course, students work in SMU teams to communicate their recommendations persuasively through corporate documents like executive summaries and Slidedocs. Through whole-class and small-group discussions, students explore theories on virtual communication and working in remote teams, and familiarize themselves with tools for cultural analysis and virtual collaboration.\n\nIn the culminating capstone project in collaboration with the University of Southern California (USC), students will work in global teams comprising students from universities across Asia, Europe and America to develop a proposal for a corporate client. Past industry partners of the VBP project included companies such as Google, Starbucks, Netflix, Tesla and SpaceX. Over 6 weeks, students collaborate virtually with their global counterparts to craft a report to the client of their choice, recommending strategies to enhance the client’s corporate reputation. In the course of the project, students use social and AI-driven collaboration tools, navigate cross-cultural team processes and learn to collaborate effectively across borders and time zones.\n\nThe deliverables in this course can be included in students’ portfolio of written and reflective work to showcase their ability to produce industry and discipline-specific communication outcomes. USC will award certificates of achievement to all participants."

        "description": "Professional Writing will expand and deepen students’ ability to write effectively in civic and corporate contexts. Such writing skills emerge in leaders who not only know how to analyze and articulate complex problems but also know how to envision and express written solutions that reveal solid decision-making on public policy, and business and societal trends.\n\nWhile the Writing & Reasoning course, taken by most SMU students in their first year, focuses on breadth, here the students will be deepening their skills by exploring and writing about more complex issues in society and business. Students will engage with the need for deeper research, better audience analysis, and more structured writing, with a more nuanced adaptation to the context appropriate to their intended publications.\n\nStudents will consider and respond to meaningful real-world issues and situations in each of the three written projects. They will explore not only what other people have said about the issues that they confront, but also develop and communicate their own responses. The finished pieces will form the basis of a portfolio of written work to showcase their ability to think critically, conduct appropriate literature research, analyse their findings, argue their case, and produce professional communication outcomes. This portfolio will be a valuable addition to their resumes when they graduate.\n\nThe final project will be an in-depth feature piece written for either Rice Media (https://www.ricemedia.co/) or the Skeptic Magazine (https://www.skeptic.org.uk/).\n\nRice Media, and Skeptic Magazine editors advise the students during the Week 10 presentations, and students will have the chance to have their work published by the media outlet that they write for after the term finishes."
